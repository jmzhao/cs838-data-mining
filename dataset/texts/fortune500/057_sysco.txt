The logistics giant is riding the e-commerce wave. Smaller than its rival UPS, FedEx specializes in the less lucrative domain of express delivery. The company has an extensive footprint across the globe, including a driver network that boasts more than 100,000 vehicles. Last year the company picked up Dutch delivery company TNT Express for nearly $5 billion in a deal that boosts its presence in Europe. Investors got the jitters earlier this year when Amazon said it would lease 20 Boeing planes for an air cargo fleet, positioning itself as a possible competitor to FedEx down the line. However, shipping is a tough business that requires ample infrastructure and expertise, which FedEx has in spades.
