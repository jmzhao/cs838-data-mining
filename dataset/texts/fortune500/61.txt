Another quarter, another revenue slide for the tech behemoth. Indeed, IBM recently reported its sixteenth straight quarter of declining sales, which puts CEO Ginni Rometty in a tough spot with investors. The long-time IBMer is trying to shift the attention to the 104-year-old company’s newer businesses: cloud computing, mobility, analytics, and security as well as bold partnerships and acquisitions. (Its latest splurge was on data company Truven Health Analytics, which it is buying for $2.6 billion.)

Last year’s revenue, which came in at $82.5 billion, represented a more than 12% drop from the year before.
