The cord-cutting trend doesn’t appear to be hurting Comcast–yet. The cable giant brought in $74.5 billion in sales in 2015, an increase of more than 8% from the year before. An investment in improving customer service and revamping its set-top box line appears to be paying off: In the first quarter of 2016, Comcast added 53,000 subscribers (now totalling 23 million). And while its not-so-long-ago failed bid for Time Warner Cable was a blow, it recently snagged a smaller yet strategic consolation prize–in April the Philadelphia-based company picked up Hollywood’s DreamWorks Animation studio for $3.8 billion, beefing up its arsenal on the increasingly important content side.
