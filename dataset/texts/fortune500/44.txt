Mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac hasnâ€™t been as successful as its sister company, Fannie Mae, since the real estate market turned for the better in 2012. But it still has managed to return $98.2 billion to taxpayers since that time, buoyed by rising real estate prices, which have reached their pre-bubble norms nationally. The firm posted a $354 million net loss in the first quarter of 2016 due to swings in the value of its derivatives portfolio, which is sensitive to changing interest rates.
