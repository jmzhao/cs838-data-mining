Revenue for the 165-year-old drug maker slid 6.5% in 2015 largely due to currency fluctuations and divestitures. In the U.S., sales grew on the strong performance of its diabetes and cancer medications and as a result of its $8.3 billion acquisition of antibiotic maker Cubist Pharmaceuticals. The company also pressed ahead with restructuring efforts–it shed 2,000 jobs in 2015–and kept pace in the industry immunotherapy race, with the widening range of approved uses for Keytruda, Merck’s breakthrough immuno-oncology drug.
