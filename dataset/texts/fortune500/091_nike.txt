The world’s largest athletic apparel and gear maker’s 2015 can best be described in one word: dominant. Fiscal-year sales climbed to $30.6 billion from $27.8 billion as Americans and shoppers around the globe continue to be lured by the trendy swoosh. Nike’s gear is widely seen on courts and running trails, but the brand also has remained on-trend as part of the growing consumer interest in “athleisure” — a term that describes the growing acceptance of wearing athletic apparel and shoes just about anywhere. Nike is bullish about what’s ahead, projecting $50 billion in sales by 2020 due to a global shift toward fitness and significant growth from the women’s business, Jordan brand, and e-commerce sales. There’s a short-term advantage on the horizon: the Summer Olympics in Brazil will generate increased attention for athletic companies like Nike, which can springboard the event to sell more new, innovative gear.
