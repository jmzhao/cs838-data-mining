Warren Buffett’s insurance and investing conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is less about Buffett than it ever was. The company used to generate the bulk of its income from Buffett’s investment mastery. But in early 2016, Berkshire completed its $32 billion acquisition of Precision Castparts. That adds to dozens of companies Berkshire now owns from car insurance company Geico, to underwear maker Fruit of the Loom, to railroad giant Burlington Northern. The company also owns, along with private equity firm 3G, a sizable chunk of food giant Kraft Heinz. Berkshire now generates nearly three-quarters of its revenue from its non-financial operating businesses, which is good news. As of late, Buffett’s big stock market investments like IBM and American Express haven’t looked so hot.
