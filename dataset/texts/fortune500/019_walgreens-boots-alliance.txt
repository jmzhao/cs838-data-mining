Walgreens Boots Alliance has not looked healthy lately. Its partnerships with scandal-plagued Silicon Valley unicorn Theranos and controversial drug company Valeant have led to countless embarrassing headlines. Its acquisition of smaller rival Rite Aid may force it to sell off more drugstores than it really wants to. All the while, the company is still working to integrate the Alliance Boots acquisition last year and the turnover of most of its c-level executives. Still, Walgreens size gives it enormous clout with drugmakers, and the Boots products have been a big shot in the arm for its beauty business, allowing it to fend off CVSâ€™ big push in that area. And its generic drug distribution contract with AmerisourceBergen has allowed it keep costs in check by streamlining how its gets its supply of drugs.
