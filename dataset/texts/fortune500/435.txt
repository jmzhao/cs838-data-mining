WEC Energy Group–formerly known as “Wisconsin Energy Corporation”–was born in 2015 after the energy company acquired Integrys Energy (which ranked No. 404 in the 2014). This union made WEC Energy Group the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in the country, and has catapulted the company up the leagues of the Fortune 500 after over a decade’s absence.
