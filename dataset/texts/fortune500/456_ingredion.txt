Genesis Healthcare, a Pennsylvania-based provider of skilled nursing and assisted living services, has become one of the nation’s largest care providers after concluding a $5.5 billion merger with Skilled Healthcare Group. Genesis’ growth has been further enhanced by a $240 million acquisition of nursing facilities from Revera in 2015.
