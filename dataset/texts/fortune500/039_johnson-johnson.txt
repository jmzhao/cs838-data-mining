Target is in the midst of an improbable renaissance, winning back shoppers at one of the toughest times in recent retail history. The retailer has been focusing on what it does best: a better selection of merchandise that is hip yet affordable, which is the past is what has draw shoppers away from Walmart. It is also pouring billions into its e-commerce business, outpacing both Amazon and Walmart in terms of growth. At the same time, Target has partnered with such organizations as MIT and Curbside, trying to get in front of where retail is heading. Still, Targetâ€™s reset of its food business, initially planned to be unveiled in 2016, hit a speed bump as the retailer tries to find a niche in the more crowded grocery space. Nonetheless, with its Canada misadventure well behind it, and sales rising, Target is flush with money to keep experimenting and reinventing itself for the new retail era.
