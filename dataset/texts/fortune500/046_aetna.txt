The world’s largest delivery company has been beating analyst expectations recently–a big change from just two years ago when the company consistently under-delivered. Booming e-commerce continues to impact the company’s operations, leading to more residential delivery–though the company makes less money on home delivery than on fulfilling bulk business to business shipments. UPS last year acquired truck broker Coyote Logistics for $1.8 billion. More hubs and automation are giving the company runway for growth. On the other hand, a potential multi-billion-dollar pension fund obligation hangs over the company’s head, pending a U.S. Treasury ruling. Rivals like FedEx and, increasingly down the line, Amazon, pose threats to the business.
