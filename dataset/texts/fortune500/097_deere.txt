The top maker of agricultural machinery is taking a page from Silicon Valley, investing in mobile apps that let farmers monitor the spacing between seeds and connecting its iconic green tractors and combines with sensors that detect when a machine needs to be repaired or replaced. The new focus on tech is an effort to fight slumping sales. But it’s an uphill battle. Falling crop prices have put a massive dent in Deere’s sales, which came in at $28.9 billion in 2015, 20% down from the year before. What’s worse, the company expects that 2016 will be even worse for the farming business.
