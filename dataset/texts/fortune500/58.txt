Bad news for global stability usually means good news at defense giants like Lockheed Martin. With the threat of terrorism and, as a result, military budgets on the rise, the company is enjoying a favorable outlook. One of Lockheed’s major moneymakers is its F-35 joint strike fighter jet, which accounts for a fifth of its business. The world’s largest defense contractor plans to ship 53 of them this year, up from 45 in 2015. Lockheed’s $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corporation last year has provided revenue lifts at the same time that the company offloads its government IT services business.
