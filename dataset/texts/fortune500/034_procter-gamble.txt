Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, which counts Pampers, Tide, and Gillette among its largest brands, has been on a multi-year disposal program that’s seen the company shed over 100 of its brands. P&G plans to hang on to just 40%, or 65 of its 165 brands, and its largest and most profitable group of laundry detergent products will end up accounting for about 85% of revenue when the restructuring is completed by the third quarter of 2016. In order to jumpstart sales, new CEO David Taylor is trying to streamline decisionmaking as well, in hopes that it will spur new innovation. P&G is targeting $10 billion of savings in 2020, which it says it will reinvest to kickstart top-line sales growth. P&G’s organic sales growth has lagged of late, hitting just 1% in the first quarter of 2016 and trailing rivals Reckitt Benckiser (5%), Unilever (5%), and L’Oreal (4%).
