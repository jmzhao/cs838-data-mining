For the past eight years, the 80-year old privately held super market chain in six Southeastern states and based in Lakeland, Fla. has been on a slow growth trajectory under CEO Ed Crenshaw, who semi-retired in May 2016 but will continue as chairman. He hands the reins of the world’s largest employee-owned company over to Todd Jones, a lifelong Publix associate and the first non-family member to lead it. Jones inherits a retail brand that is as loved by generations of faithful shoppers as it is by its 180,000 employees, who are also co-owners via a very healthy stock ownership plan. Jones will also oversee Publix’s further expansion as it plans to open stores in Virginia in 2017. Also read: Bag Boy Confidential: My Five Days as a Publix Employee
