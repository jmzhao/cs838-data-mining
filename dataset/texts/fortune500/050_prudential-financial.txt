The chipmaker missed the boat on mobile and is now trying to solidify its position as a supplier of the “new new” wave of computing: the so-called Internet of Things. That means it is making connected chips for anything from self-driving cars to jet engines. And it hasn’t entirely given up on mobile either. It was recently reported that Intel will supply up to 50% of the modems for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 7. Last November, the company landed another coup when it poached Murthy Renduchintala from Qualcomm to lead its newly-formed IoT division. But those wins haven’t been enough to stem the losses. Last year’s revenue came in at $55.4 billion, down 1% from the year before, with its PC and software groups seeing the biggest declines.
