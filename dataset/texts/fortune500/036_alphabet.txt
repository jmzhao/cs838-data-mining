Alphabet, the company formerly known as Google, continues to forge ahead since reorganizing in August 2015. Its core unit, Google, which includes its money-printing advertising business, mobile operating system Android, and video network YouTube, remains the company’s crown jewel. In the first quarter of 2016, Alphabet’s core business generated $20.1 billion in revenue, far eclipsing the $166 million its moonshots like self-driving cars and other bets like home automation company Nest generated that quarter. Consumer products from Google are continuing to gain steam–the Google Photos service, for example, has grown to 200 million monthly active users since its debut a year earlier. The company’s lightweight Chromebook laptops recently outpaced shipments of Apple’s desktop computers in the U.S. with a total of nearly 2 million machines in this year’s first quarter, according to IDC. But that doesn’t mean Alphabet is putting its unorthodox ideas on the back burner: self-driving cars are now being tested in multiple cities and the company has announced ambitious plans for virtual reality, including headsets, a new platform, and a partnership with IMAX.
