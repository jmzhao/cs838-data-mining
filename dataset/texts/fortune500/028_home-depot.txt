Home Depot has been nailing it, quarter after quarter. The do-it-yourself home improvement retailer has benefited from the housing recovery and people’s willingness to invest in big home projects now that they’re more confident that their homes will keep their value. Newish CEO Craig Menear has kept the momentum going, building up Home Depot’s e-commerce and expanding its private label products contractors swear by. Big-ticket items like power washers and lumber have been selling well. The only leaky faucet in its business outlook is the specter of higher interest rates that could slow housing market. Still, all signs point to continued momentum. Home Depot expects 1.9 million households will form this year, up from 1.3 million last year. And with nearly two-thirds of U.S. homes older than 30 years old, there will be need for home improvement products for a long time.
