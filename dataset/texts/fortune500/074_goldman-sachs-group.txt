Goldman Sachs’ business model is not as precious as it used to be. CEO Lloyd Blankfein, back after a bout with cancer, is embarking on a cost cutting effort. At the same time the bank is changing its long-held focus on the top tiers of corporate America, and the 1%. It recently announced a plan to start an internet bank that caters to middle income Americans. Goldman also in early 2016 bought a company that manages 401(k) plans for small businesses. All of those moves will hopefully boost Goldman’s profitability, which is still way below where it was before the financial crisis.
