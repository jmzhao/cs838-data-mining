The global snacking giant has reported sharply lower sales in recent quarters, with results stung by two issues: a strong U.S. dollar has ate into the company’s top line and the loss of Mondelez’s coffee brands after it sold them to create a new company called Jacobs Douwe Egberts. Mondelez still has a noncontrolling stake in the new company, but the loss of the business has helped contribute to double-digit revenue declines in recent quarters. This year, Mondelez is only targeting net organic revenue growth of at least 2%, conceding that a challenging macroeconomic environment will result in slower growth for the global $1.2 trillion snacking market. Mondelez is planning to focus on so-called “power brands,” which include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, Cadbury chocolate, and Trident gum, while also eliminating less profitable lines to help simplify the company’s supply chain.
