Best Buy has defied expectations it could thrive in an era of online shopping. Through moves like creating areas that focus on such product categories as smart homes; partnering with Apple; and overhauling its tech-assistance Geek Squad services business, Best Buy has managed to keep stores relevant. Still, the retailer has been slammed by low TV prices and softness in the mobile phone sales, resulting in a weak holiday season in 2015, again raising questions about how long it can keep fending off Amazon. In the meantime, Best Buy continues to try new things, like shop in shops at some Macyâ€™s stores.
