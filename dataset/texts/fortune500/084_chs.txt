The largest farmer- and rancher-owned cooperative in the U.S. with $34.6 billion in sales provides the stuff farmers need to grow crops–fuel and farm supplies–and then buys growers’ harvests to either sell or process. CHS saw its profits drop nearly 28% as its agriculture segment took a hit from the reduced selling prices of grain. The cooperative’s energy segment, which also refines and retails petroleum, suffered from a 28% drop in the price of refined fuels and weak demand for propane due to a warm winter. The company took a charge for ending development on a planned nitrogen fertilizer plant and instead decided to make the biggest investment in its history ($2.8 billion) in an existing fertilizer operation.
