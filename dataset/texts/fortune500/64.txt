For a second consecutive year, New York Life Insurance’s managed assets soared past $500 billion in 2015—and that wasn’t the only highlight in the mutual life insurance behemoth’s most recent annual report. The firm also brought in a record $1.3 billion in sales, is planning a record $1.7 billion dividend payout to policyholders in 2016, and achieved operating earnings of $1.9 billion (second only to its record $2.02 billion in 2014 operating earnings). New York Life, along with AIG, also sold an industry-topping $3 billion in fixed annuities in the first quarter of 2016. Analysts from Limra expect sales in the fixed annuity market to continue spiking in the face of market volatility.
