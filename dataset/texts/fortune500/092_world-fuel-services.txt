Diversified products conglomerate 3M saw a slight drop in net income in 2016, but has a five-year plan to increase earnings-per-share by between 8 and 11 percent by 2020. The Minnesota-based company recently opened a new science center where it plans to work on new innovations across its all of its business divisions. The diversity of the product offerings from 3M is truly impressive; the company makes everything rom Scotch tape and Command adhesives to Post-It notes to home organization products, not to mention specialized products for industries ranging from orthodontistry to aerospace engineering.
