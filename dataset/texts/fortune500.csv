intro
"Walmart is making a lot of progress in adapting its big-box approach to the 21st century and has become the second largest online retailer in the U.S. after Amazon. By giving workers raises and investing heavily in tech, its U.S. division has improved customer service and saw comparable sales rise each quarter in 2015. It is hoping to build on that with a major reset of its food business, which accounts for more than half of its sales, with a bigger focus on organic and fresh food, and by offering curbside order pick up. The retailer has also proven it can hold its own with the tech giants, rollouting out Walmart Pay across the U.S. But huge challenges remain for the world’s largest company. Its e-commerce growth lags that of its main rivals. Its Sam’s Club unit is struggling to keep up with Costco. What’s more, its international division is being buffeted by a strong U.S. dollar that is eating into profits. Total sales fell for the first time in 2015."
"The world’s largest publicly-traded oil and gas company by market value (China’s Sinopec and Royal Dutch Shell are larger by revenue) has ridden out the collapse in crude prices better than most, its vertically-integrated model allowing downstream businesses to capture the value that upstream operations lose when oil prices are low. Even so, ExxonMobil’s once impregnable balance sheet is showing holes: the company lost its AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor’s in April after 67 years. Total spending on investments and dividends was 40% more than the combined cash flow from operations and asset sales in 2015 (it wants to cut capex by 25% this year). ExxonMobil remains the industry benchmark for everything from profitability to safety standards, but its rocky relationship with climate change remains its Achilles’ heel. State attorneys in both New York and California have opened probes into whether it misled investors over the risks to its business from climate change, against a background of allegations (which it denies) that it suppressed scientific research that came to inconvenient conclusions."
"Warren Buffett’s insurance and investing conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is less about Buffett than it ever was. The company used to generate the bulk of its income from Buffett’s investment mastery. But in early 2016, Berkshire completed its $32 billion acquisition of Precision Castparts. That adds to dozens of companies Berkshire now owns from car insurance company Geico, to underwear maker Fruit of the Loom, to railroad giant Burlington Northern. The company also owns, along with private equity firm 3G, a sizable chunk of food giant Kraft Heinz. Berkshire now generates nearly three-quarters of its revenue from its non-financial operating businesses, which is good news. As of late, Buffett’s big stock market investments like IBM and American Express haven’t looked so hot."
"After more than a decade of solid growth fueled first by the iPod music player and then by the even more popular iPhone, Apple finally appeared to hit a wall. Still the most profitable publicly-traded company in the world, Apple’s iPhone 6S and 6S Plus upgrades barely outsold their predecessors after arriving on the market at the end of 2015, while sales of the iPad tablet computer continued to shrink throughout the year. In April 2015, the Apple Watch arrived to mixed reviews and modest sales. And though debate raged for a bit about the state of Apple’s sales in China amid a slowing economy there — including an unusual August 2015 email from CEO Tim Cook to CNBC host Jim Cramer claiming no summer slowdown — the year ended on a weak note for the company in Asia. Lately, hopes have turned to the next iPhone upgrade cycle and a push to focus on India, where Apple’s market share remains miniscule. Still, even with the growing concerns, Apple’s next big leap came into view in 2015. Dubbed Project Titan and staffed with hordes of former car industry experts, Apple’s effort to leapfrog the automobile market with an electric masterpiece likely won’t reach consumers for a few more years. But when it does, Cook and company could be riding high again."
"McKesson, the largest U.S. pharmaceutical distributor, is facing some major obstacles these days. After years of strong sales growth thanks to generic drug price inflation, the tailwind is expected to slow and cut into the company’s overall revenue growth in 2015. McKesson also recently lost a handful of customers and could potentially lose another $13 billion worth of revenue in 2018 when (or if) Rite Aid is acquired by Walgreens. Management has been working on a series of maneuvers to lessen these blows, including acquiring strategic bolt-on companies to replace lost business and implementing a restructuring plan that’s expected to generate about $180 million in savings this fiscal year."
"UnitedHealth Group, America’s largest health insurer, had a year marked by notable departures. Just weeks after its inclusion on last year’s Fortune 500, the firm left the industry’s largest trade group, America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), asserting that the association had adopted a strategy “that does not fit UnitedHealth Group and our diversified portfolio.” More recently, the company announced that it would be leaving most of Obamacare’s statewide individual insurance marketplaces thanks to mounting losses. Both decisions speak to the insurance giant’s willingness to go it alone. That makes sense given its sheer size and the reach of its business–UnitedHealth has more than 100 million global customers. The insurer has also grown its health services platform Optum and pharmacy benefits unit OptumRx with major investments like the $12.8 billion buyout of Catamaran, as well as a recent mail-order prescription drug distribution agreement with pharmacy chain Walgreens which positions UnitedHealth as a competitor to CVS Health and Express Scripts."
"AT&T veered into a new direction in 2015 as some of its mainstay businesses ran into trouble. A continued assault from revitalized wireless carrier T-Mobile helped strip away almost two million of AT&T’s monthly mobile subscribers. And the old legacy landline phone business accelerated its decline, losing almost 10% of its revenue from the year before. So CEO Randall Stephenson made two bold gambles that may — or may not — pay off in coming years. First, he spent almost $50 billion to acquire satellite television provider DirecTV. Along with its existing cable television offering Uverse, the move immediately made AT&T one of the largest TV subscription services in the world with 26 million U.S. customers and 19 million overseas. AT&T also acquired Nextel Mexico and Iusacell for less than $5 billion. Combining the two and upgrading its Mexican infrastructure could pay off if Latin America continues to grow faster than many other parts of the world. In the meantime, AT&T can profit from the immense flow of trade and communication between the U.S. and Mexico. The television play looks riskier, as cord cutting accelerates among millennials and Internet video services like Netflix gain momentum."
"CVS Health is still feeling the pinch from its 2014 decision to drop cigarettes. But the company continues to leverage the positive PR to convince more employers that it’s truly a health care company, allowing it to win new business for its Caremark pharmacy benefits manager. Though the PBM eclipsed its retail drugstore business in size a few years ago, the company continued expanding its CVS/pharmacy business, which has been grappling with declines in comparable sales. CVS recently took over 1,700 in-store drugstores from Target and is rolling out order pickup with tech startup Curbside this year. It is also continuing to push healthier food options in its stores to burnish its image as a healthcare company and improve its beauty selection to better compete with arch-rival Walgreens."
"Under long-serving CEO Jeff Immelt, GE is undergoing a major transformation to refocus on its bedrock industrial businesses. In the process, Immelt is dismantling the legacy of his legendary predecessor, Jack Welch. In early 2015, Immelt and his team made the landmark decision to sell most of GE Capital, the lending business built by Welch that once generated half of the conglomerate’s profits but sank under the heavy regulatory regime adopted following the financial crisis. In just eighteen months, Immelt has sold, or reached agreements to shed, $171 billion of the financial arm’s $200 billion in assets. In mid-January 2016, GE agreed to unload another barely profitable bulwark, its consumer appliance franchise, to Haier of China for $5.4 billion. Immelt is betting heavily on lighting homes and powering plants across the globe; in November, GE acquired the power generation arm of France’s Alstom for $10 billion, greatly strengthening its reach in gas-fired, “combined cycle” plants that are driving the industry’s growth. So far, the results are mixed. In the first quarter, three GE staples — jet engines, medical equipment, and power generation — all showed good revenue growth, while two others, oil and gas, and transportation equipment, including locomotives, dropped sharply. All told GE’s industrial profits fell 7% from the first quarter of 2015. Indeed, the strategic thrust is daring, and so far shareholders are applauding: Since the start of 2015, GE’s stock has delivered a 25% return, easily waxing the S&P 500 by 23 points."
"Last year Ford posted its best U.S. sales performance since 2006. The newly revamped F-Series Trucks were a particularly bright spot, with more than 780,000 vehicles sold. The company will look to continue that streak as the market is expected to grow again this year, thanks to low gas prices. The company will also likely continue to push into automated driving technology to keep up with increasing competition. Ford had been in talks with technology companies like Google and Uber recently, but ultimately decided not to partner with either. CEO Mark Fields noted that company culture was a big reason for this. Fields has made a lot of noise about his commitment to growing Ford as a tech company, and that should continue as the industry continues to automate."
"In 2015, General Motors’ most important goal was to distance itself from the ignition switch recall scandal that cast a pall over the historic brand for much of the previous year. It also had a record sales year to boot, with a total profit of $9.7 billion. For 2016, GM will look to continue staking its claim on a still growing U.S. auto market. The company is also inching towards the release of automated cars, a development that could potentially change the game for GM and the auto industry all together within the next decade."
"Verizon Communications moved to get smaller in 2015. A year after spending $130 billion to buy out wireless parter Vodafone, CEO Lowell McAdam sought to slim down and pay down some of the over $110 billion of long term debt he accumulated to pull off the buyout. That required selling off profitable but geographically remote landline telephone and FiOS cable television and Internet businesses in California, Texas and Florida to Frontier Communications for $10.5 billion. He raised another $5 billion selling off rights to more 11,000 cellular towers. Still, McAdam did need to make a few strategic additions. Verizon has frequently been rated as having the most comprehensive and widespread wireless network in the country but those airwaves have been filling up and getting ever more crowded. So McAdam spent big at the government’s Advanced Wireless Services spectrum auction, grabbing another 181 licenses. And in a play to move beyond subscription revenue and capture some of the growing digital advertising pie, McAdam snapped up AOL for $4 billion."
"AmerisourceBergen is the second-largest distributor of pharmaceuticals in the U.S. As such, it’s subject to many of the same forces affecting McKesson, its top competitor. Generic drug price deflation and fewer expected generic-drug launches will put pressure on overall industry profits this year and next. AmerisourceBergen has been working to counter those effects by entering new markets through strategic acquisitions. This includes getting into animal health distribution with MWI Veterinary Supply, compounding with PharMEDium, and clinical trial logistics with World Courier. AmerisourceBergen also could face a windfall of new revenue in coming years after its partner Walgreens absorbs Rite Aid and its more than 4,500 pharmacists."
"Costco Wholesale may be grappling with lower gas prices that are eating into its sales growth, but the bulk retailer still manages to outperform Sam’s Club every quarter. Costco, which benefits from having stores in more affluent areas than Sam’s does, has been looking to pad its lead by improving its merchandise, particularly fresh food, a key category for getting shoppers into stores. And given how Costco is an e-commerce laggard compared to rivals in terms of offering services like store pickup of online orders, finding ways to promote shopper traffic are essential. Some initiatives have included on-site bread baking at some stores. And its $15 billion-a-year Kirkland store brand is a cash cow that is only growing in popularity. Still, Costco will have to deal with a newly aggressive Sam’s Club which has made no secret of its intention to go higher end, aiming squarely at Costco’s customers."
"Mortgage-finance giant Fannie Mae has been in conservatorship since the company nearly went bust and required a government takeover in late 2008. But ever since 2012, when real estate prices finally starting rising again nationwide, the firm has been a cash cow for the United States government, returning $147.6 billion to the Treasury Department’s coffers, far more than the $116.1 billion bailout it received. The fact that it is required now to send all of its profits to the Treasury rather than rebuilding its capital is controversial because the policy means that Fannie would have to tap the Treasury again if the market goes sour and it starts losing money once again. Housing finance reform, however, remains stalled in Congress, like much else these days."
"Most of the supermarket industry has fallen prey to Walmart’s drive into grocery over the last decade–but not Kroger. The Cincinnati-based supermarket giant continued its streak in its last fiscal year, as profits jumped 18%, market share increased, and same-store sales grew 5% (excluding fuel) for the year. The fourth quarter of 2015 marked Kroger’s 49th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. The 133-year-old company kept up its acquisition tear by buying the Roundy chain, giving Kroger a foothold in Wisconsin. The company has pursued a robust private label line, with about 40% of its own brand made by the company’s facilities that include dairies, delis, cheese plants, and bakeries. This current fiscal year might not be as rosy for the U.S.’s second-largest food retailer. Kroger has warned that its sales growth could be perhaps the worst in more than a decade in part due to shaky consumer confidence and low commodity costs."
"The U.S.’s second-biggest oil and gas producer went into the 2014 oil crash in a weaker position than ExxonMobil and is struggling more, accordingly, in its efforts to come to terms with the new low price environment. Where Chevron has ended its share buyback program, Exxon’s is still going (albeit in reduced scale). Chevron’s restructuring costs drove it to a loss in the first quarter of 2016, while Exxon remains profitable. Last October, it said it would cut up to 10% of its 70,000 workforce. It has already twice cut its estimated investment budget for this year to conserve cash, and is offload non-core assets like its refinery in Hawaii where it can. On the brighter side, projects that have consumed enormous amounts of money in the past, like the Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in Australia, are finally coming on stream, and its balance sheet, while not as strong as Exxon’s, is still strong enough for it to allow CEO John Watson to be on the lookout for bargains as the market recovers."
"The Everything Store has entered into a new era — of profitability. The e-commerce giant founded by Jeff Bezos has gone from black sheep to Wall Street darling, thanks to four consecutive quarters of record profits. Amazon’s hardware business is taking off thanks to a hit with the nascent internet of things and newer, cheaper tablets. The company’s voice-controlled home automation device, Echo, has become one of Amazon’s most desired products and sales of its Fire tablets outpaced those of Apple’s iPads during last year’s Black Friday. Amazon Prime, the company’s subscription service for faster free delivery and streaming services of video and music, continues to serve as a lucrative business. In particular, Amazon has been doubling down on its streaming service, launching new original content for TV and movies, as well as offering a standalone streaming service for customers to rival Netflix. Up next? The e-commerce giant is quietly building a shipping network of trucks, planes, and freight to get deliveries to customers faster, taking on the likes of FedEx and UPS."
"Walgreens Boots Alliance has not looked healthy lately. Its partnerships with scandal-plagued Silicon Valley unicorn Theranos and controversial drug company Valeant have led to countless embarrassing headlines. Its acquisition of smaller rival Rite Aid may force it to sell off more drugstores than it really wants to. All the while, the company is still working to integrate the Alliance Boots acquisition last year and the turnover of most of its c-level executives. Still, Walgreens size gives it enormous clout with drugmakers, and the Boots products have been a big shot in the arm for its beauty business, allowing it to fend off CVS’ big push in that area. And its generic drug distribution contract with AmerisourceBergen has allowed it keep costs in check by streamlining how its gets its supply of drugs."
"It was the end of an era for Hewlett Packard. The 76-year old business technology giant spent the majority of 2015 undertaking one of the most complicated corporate separations in history. Although Hewlett Packard was still a massive company with annual revenue at over $100 billion, the rise of cloud computing and the weakening personal computer and printer market took a toll on Hewlett Packard, which continued to see sales decline each quarter. To better compete in the changing marketplace, CEO Meg Whitman led the effort to split the company into two separate businesses with the idea that each could better concentrate on their own specialties and react more quickly to market changes. Additionally, the technology giant announced that it would shed over 30,000 jobs before it officially split in November 2015. Now, Whitman is the CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which sells data center hardware and business software, while Dion Weisler leads printer and personal computer maker HP, Inc. Unfortunately for HPE and HP, the technology market continued its chill in early 2016 and both companies saw first quarter revenue declines."
"The world’s largest aerospace company is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. So far it’s off to a turbulent centennial: the company’s stock price has dropped 20% from an all-time high of nearly $160 per share in Feb. 2015. Investors are trepidatious after the company, which generates about two-thirds of its revenue from its commercial business and the rest from defense contracting, said it would deliver 740 to 745 commercial aircraft this year–less than the record 762 it delivered last year. The company also said it would lay off 4,000 workers in an effort to cut costs and that it would earn less than expected this year. Low oil prices have softened customer demand for the company’s latest and more fuel-efficient plane models, such as its costly 787 Dreamliner. Competition from rivals Airbus Group and Bombardier pose a threat to its lucrative single aisle 737 jetliner business. Meanwhile, the SEC is investigating multple years of the company’s accounting and financial filings."
"Cardinal Health, a drug wholesaler that also makes gloves and surgical apparel, has been shoring up its future earnings through a series of strategic acquisitions, development of its alternate care business, and promotion of its specialty drug assets. The company has spent $5.7 billion on acquisitions since 2011, including paying $1.94 billion for Johnson & Johnson’s Cordis heart-product business. The deal closed ahead of schedule in late 2015. Along with the Cordis integration and a recent deal with Henry Shein, Cardinal Health will also be focused on its Red Oak venture over the next year. The 10-year split generics buying operation with CVS is a strong earnings booster. The partnerships and purchases are a way for Cardinal Health to snag a greater share of the medical products sold to hospitals, physicians, and ambulatory centers."
"Over the past decade, Express Scripts has become the largest pharmacy benefit manager in the U.S. as the industry has consolidated. The company processes some 1.5 billion claims every year. The question now is if it can compete using its unique stand-alone business model with rivals like CVS Health that pursue a multi-pronged approach. Express Scripts has benefited from the wave of newly insured patients as a result of the Affordable Care Act and has significantly expanded its profit margins over the past five years, hitting 6.9% in 2015 compared to 5.4% in 2010. However, the company is at risk of losing its biggest customer. Express Scripts has been locked in a contract dispute with insurance giant Anthem, which accused Express Scripts of breach of contract and requested damages of as much as $13 billion. Anthem accounted for about 16% of Express Scripts’ revenue in 2015, and the likelihood of a contract renewal by 2019 is at stake."
"After Satya Nadella’s second year as CEO, Microsoft continues to realign itself around cloud computing–no mean feat considering that it built its profitable franchise on Windows and Office software that runs on customers’ internal servers and PCs. Now Microsoft must convince them to use more Office 365, which runs in Microsoft’s own data centers, without overly cannibalizing sales of old-fashioned, on-premise Office, Exchange, and other applications. And it means convincing startups and consumers who are more into Linux or Apple to view Microsoft Azure, the company’s public cloud infrastructure, as a welcoming place for their work as well. So far, Nadella has gotten good reviews: Azure is seen as the only public cloud that can give Amazon Web Services a run for its money, although it remains a distant second. And by all accounts, Office 365 has gained traction. Microsoft also hopes its year-old Windows 10 operating system will please existing Windows shops and stem defections to Apple or ChromeBook devices. And it continues to deal with fallout from the decision to buy Nokia’s phone business two years ago, which resulted in a $7.5 billion write-down last year."
"Bank of America, with its enormous retail banking franchise, could be one of the big winners when interest rates really begin to rise. That, unfortunately for B of A, has yet to happen. Instead, the bank is still struggling to boost profitability in the low interest rate environment. CEO Brian Moynihan has instituted cost cutting plans dubbed “New BAC” and “Simplify and Improve,” but the company’s actual performance has only improved modestly. Moynihan may have to wait until rates rise before he can see the new new BAC."
"Jamie Dimon has mostly won over critics that claimed his bank J.P. Morgan Chase should be broken up. But he’s done it, in part, by pairing down. J.P. Morgan is still the biggest bank in the U.S., but since last year its assets have shrunk by $150 billion to $2.4 trillion. Among the big banks it has appears to have figured out how to navigate the post-financial crisis landscape the best. The bank says it believes its bottom line will reach $30 billion by 2019."
"2016 has not been kind to the nation’s largest banks, and Wells Fargo is no exception. Its recent performance was weighed down by troubles in the energy sector, as the bank has billions of outstanding loans out to oil and gas companies that are struggling to repay. It’s wealth management division will also now have to contend with the much-feared fiduciary rule, which will upend the way banks like Wells Fargo dispense financial advice. That said, the long term outlook for the bank is strong, as it surpassed Citigroup this year to become the third largest bank in America by assets, while it is nearly unrivaled in its focus on its main street customers who give the bank more than a trillion dollars in low cost deposits."
"Home Depot has been nailing it, quarter after quarter. The do-it-yourself home improvement retailer has benefited from the housing recovery and people’s willingness to invest in big home projects now that they’re more confident that their homes will keep their value. Newish CEO Craig Menear has kept the momentum going, building up Home Depot’s e-commerce and expanding its private label products contractors swear by. Big-ticket items like power washers and lumber have been selling well. The only leaky faucet in its business outlook is the specter of higher interest rates that could slow housing market. Still, all signs point to continued momentum. Home Depot expects 1.9 million households will form this year, up from 1.3 million last year. And with nearly two-thirds of U.S. homes older than 30 years old, there will be need for home improvement products for a long time."
"Citigroup’s far-flung operations have long been one of its greatest strengths. CEO Mike Corbat formerly ran the bank’s operations in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, but being the most exposed to the emerging markets has been a liability lately. Still the firm’s financial strength is among the best of the big banks these days, a big turnaround from 2008, when Citi nearly failed in the financial crisis. Citi came back to life by becoming super cost efficient, but the boost from cost cutting may be coming to an end. Recently revenue has been falling faster than Citi can cut expenses."
"Like many companies that buy and refine crude oil and natural gas rather than selling them, Phillips 66 has been able to watch the devastation of the collapse in crude prices with relative calm. Admittedly, refining margins, which expanded as crude fell, compressed again earlier in 2016, causing it to miss analysts’ profit forecasts by a wide margin in the first quarter. But with U.S. gasoline demand set to rise this year, natural gas taking market share from coal in the electric power market, and with steady growth in global demand for plastics, its core businesses seem reasonably well set. On the downside, it has spent a lot of money to fit its refineries for processing (largely Canadian) heavy crude, which is at the wrong end of the global cost curve. But it has the confidence of Warren Buffett, who made it the fifth-largest holding in his portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year, and it has a strong balance sheet even after whittling away its cash pile to increase dividends and stock buybacks. Major developments planned for this year include the completion of the Freeport LPG export terminal on the Gulf Coast."
"Valero has arguably enjoyed the domestic glut of crude oil in recent years more that anyone, having topped the stock performance tables along with its refining brethren since 2012. Times are getting tougher now that domestic crude production is falling and that the ban on exports of U.S. crude has been lifted. After a weak first quarter earnings report for 2016, its stock hit a low that was 25% off last year’s peak. But the world’s largest independent refiner — with 15 plants processing 3 million barrels of oil a day — is still managing to churn out cash and invest in new capacity: a new crude processing unit at its Corpus Christi, Tx., plant and a catalytic cracking unit at St. Charles, La., have both come on stream in recent months and will increase its refining capacity by over 105,000 barrels per day in net terms this year."
"The cord-cutting trend doesn’t appear to be hurting Comcast–yet. The cable giant brought in $74.5 billion in sales in 2015, an increase of more than 8% from the year before. An investment in improving customer service and revamping its set-top box line appears to be paying off: In the first quarter of 2016, Comcast added 53,000 subscribers (now totalling 23 million). And while its not-so-long-ago failed bid for Time Warner Cable was a blow, it recently snagged a smaller yet strategic consolation prize–in April the Philadelphia-based company picked up Hollywood’s DreamWorks Animation studio for $3.8 billion, beefing up its arsenal on the increasingly important content side."
"The 130-year old healthcare conglomerate sells everything from baby shampoo to surgical staples and cancer drugs (it also divested itself of Splenda, the artificial sweetener.) That diversification helped buoy giant J&J in 2015; the company’s strong pharmaceutical sales made up for the less impressive performances of its consumer and medical device divisions. The company’s revenues grew 2.6% in the US, but slid 5.7% worldwide in 2015, largely due to currency fluctuations and the sharp decline in sales of its Hepatitis C drug, Olysio."
"Health insurance titan Anthem announced one of last year’s biggest acquisitions with a proposed $54 billion deal to buy competitor Cigna. While Cigna has recently warned that the deal may not close in 2016, the combined company would leapfrog UnitedHealth Group to become the nation’s largest insurer if approved. Anthem, which has more than 38 million people enrolled in its various health plans and boasted $62 billion in 2014 assets, has stood apart from prominent rivals when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Rival UnitedHealth recently announced it would be departing from all but a “handful” of the health law’s statewide insurance markets; by contrast, Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish told investors in April that a “sustainable market can be built” for the Obamacare exchanges. The company has also been locking horns with pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) Express Scripts, the number one provider of such prescription drug services in the U.S. Swedish made waves during this year’s annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference when he claimed that Scripts was failing to pass on billions in savings from its price negotiations with drugmakers and threatened to break ties with the PBM (Anthem is Scripts’ biggest client). The contract dispute has grown increasingly nasty, with Anthem suing Express Scripts in March for $15 billion in damages and the right to terminate a 10-year contract with the benefits manager; Scripts promptly countersued Anthem in April 2016."
"Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, which counts Pampers, Tide, and Gillette among its largest brands, has been on a multi-year disposal program that’s seen the company shed over 100 of its brands. P&G plans to hang on to just 40%, or 65 of its 165 brands, and its largest and most profitable group of laundry detergent products will end up accounting for about 85% of revenue when the restructuring is completed by the third quarter of 2016. In order to jumpstart sales, new CEO David Taylor is trying to streamline decisionmaking as well, in hopes that it will spur new innovation. P&G is targeting $10 billion of savings in 2020, which it says it will reinvest to kickstart top-line sales growth. P&G’s organic sales growth has lagged of late, hitting just 1% in the first quarter of 2016 and trailing rivals Reckitt Benckiser (5%), Unilever (5%), and L’Oreal (4%)."
"Alphabet, the company formerly known as Google, continues to forge ahead since reorganizing in August 2015. Its core unit, Google, which includes its money-printing advertising business, mobile operating system Android, and video network YouTube, remains the company’s crown jewel. In the first quarter of 2016, Alphabet’s core business generated $20.1 billion in revenue, far eclipsing the $166 million its moonshots like self-driving cars and other bets like home automation company Nest generated that quarter. Consumer products from Google are continuing to gain steam–the Google Photos service, for example, has grown to 200 million monthly active users since its debut a year earlier. The company’s lightweight Chromebook laptops recently outpaced shipments of Apple’s desktop computers in the U.S. with a total of nearly 2 million machines in this year’s first quarter, according to IDC. But that doesn’t mean Alphabet is putting its unorthodox ideas on the back burner: self-driving cars are now being tested in multiple cities and the company has announced ambitious plans for virtual reality, including headsets, a new platform, and a partnership with IMAX."
"Financial services and insurance giant MetLife announced Q1 2016 earnings that fell short of expectations, with total operating revenues taking a 2% dip and operating earnings taking a more significant 19% hit. President and CEO Steven A. Kandarian said that the results underscored continuing “market headwinds” but praised the underwriting results. During that same call, MetLife also announced it would be pulling out about $1.2 billion of the $1.8 billion that it currently has invested in hedge funds and siphon that money into other investment vehicles, following the lead of other firms like American International Group. It’s part of a growing trend away from high-fee funds. The company has also been locking horns with federal regulators who believe MetLife, the nation’s largest life insurer, is “too big to fail.” That scuffle has led the firm to consider spinning off its retail insurance and financial product business. However, a federal judge ruled against the government in March 2016, going on to say its designation of MetLife as TBTF is “arbitrary and capricious.” The government plans to appeal the ruling."
"Bloomington, Illinois-based State Farm ended 2015 in the black, buoyed by strong investment gains which more than counteracted an underwriting loss of $4.2 billion. The insurance and financial services firm saw net income soar to more than $2.1 billion — more than double the company’s 2014 net. State Farm has also put its backing behind several burgeoning new, and somewhat controversial, technologies in a bid to modernize the risk assessment model. For instance, the company recently became a customer of the fast-growing drone software startup Airware in order to inspect home rooftops and collect claims data from the skies. It’s also been pushing for drivers who own car insurance policies to put sensors in their vehicles so that State Farm can collect detailed driving data and assess just how much of a risk each of its individual policyholders is."
"Target is in the midst of an improbable renaissance, winning back shoppers at one of the toughest times in recent retail history. The retailer has been focusing on what it does best: a better selection of merchandise that is hip yet affordable, which is the past is what has draw shoppers away from Walmart. It is also pouring billions into its e-commerce business, outpacing both Amazon and Walmart in terms of growth. At the same time, Target has partnered with such organizations as MIT and Curbside, trying to get in front of where retail is heading. Still, Target’s reset of its food business, initially planned to be unveiled in 2016, hit a speed bump as the retailer tries to find a niche in the more crowded grocery space. Nonetheless, with its Canada misadventure well behind it, and sales rising, Target is flush with money to keep experimenting and reinventing itself for the new retail era."
"Ohio-based Marathon Petroleum was the worst hit of all the major independent refiners as ‘crack spreads’ — the premiums for processing crude into various fuel distillates — fell sharply at the start of 2016. Its refining division, which processes up to 1.8 million barrels of oil a day, actually swung to an operating loss in the first quarter as years of gorging on cheap domestic crude oil came to an end. To some extent, exports are taking the strain as new infrastructure becomes operational. Earnings are also stabilized by its 2,770-strong network of Speedway convenience stores — the 2nd largest gas station chain in the U.S. The company is hoping that heavy investment in the gas stations it bought from Hess in 2014 will pay off with higher sales in the coming years. It’s also growing in the ‘midstream’ business of pipelines, having absorbed MarkWest, a natural gas pipeline, into its Master Limited Partnership subsidiary MPLX last year in a deal valued at $20 billion."
"The food and beverage giant, like many Big Food rivals, faced a challenging 2015. While the soda maker’s results were resilient in North America, CEO Indra Nooyi has struck a fairly bearish tone when lamenting the state of the global economy. In her view, lower demand for commodities has put pressure on previously booming economies like Russia and Brazil, resulting in slowing sales. Because of the global economic malaise, the U.S. dollar has strengthened, also eating into PepsiCo’s sales. Global net revenue slipped to $63.1 billion in 2015 from $66.7 billion the prior year. Meanwhile, the soda industry’s sales keep sliding in the U.S. as customers cut back on sugary drinks, leading PepsiCo to tinker with how it makes key brands like Diet Pepsi and Sierra Mist. The hope is that the formula changes will help perk up sales, though it remains to be seen if such efforts will work."
"As goes the commodity market, so goes Archer Daniels Midland. Last year that was not a good thing: Sales dropped 16.6%, and profits declined 17.7%. The processor of goods like corn and wheat has been hurt by a strong dollar and a grain surplus, reducing the demand for the North American supply it processes and sells. Low oil prices and a glut of ethanol also cut into its manufacturing of the fuel additive. Management is trying to remake ADM accordingly, selling off its cocoa business and considering shedding stakes in operations like corn mills that make ethanol. Meanwhile, ADM acquired companies like Wild Flavors, Eatem Foods, and SCI to capitalize on consumers shifting their preferences toward natural goods. ADM also has made investments in organic, gluten-free ingredient company Harvest Innovation and sugar supplier Wilmar International to gain a bigger footprint in Asia."
"CEO Gregory Hayes, who took charge when Louis Chenevert abruptly departed in late 2014, shrewdly unloaded helicopter-maker Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin in November 2015 for $9 billion, just before the oil slump pummeled sales for offshore platforms served by commercial choppers. The drop in UTC’s share price early this year triggered a $90 billion takeover bid from Honeywell. Hayes rebuffed Honeywell, and his three-year, $1.5 billion cost-cutting plan has helped revive UTC’s stock. The slowdown in China is curbing revenues at the UTC’s Otis unit. But sales of jet engine parts at Pratt & Whitney, a high-margin business, are thriving. And UTC’s innovative, super-energy-efficient Geared Turbofan engine is taking flight on the new Airbus A320neo. On the political front, UTC is drawing flak from Donald Trump for announcing plans to shutter two HVAC plants in Indiana, and moving production to Mexico."
"Mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac hasn’t been as successful as its sister company, Fannie Mae, since the real estate market turned for the better in 2012. But it still has managed to return $98.2 billion to taxpayers since that time, buoyed by rising real estate prices, which have reached their pre-bubble norms nationally. The firm posted a $354 million net loss in the first quarter of 2016 due to swings in the value of its derivatives portfolio, which is sensitive to changing interest rates."
"Aetna’s 2015 revenues rose past the $60 billion mark–but the 23-million member strong health insurer has its sights set much higher. Its proposed $37 billion merger with rival Humana would birth a health insurance giant with dominance in the Medicare Advantage managed care space second only to UnitedHealth Group and give its pharmacy benefit unit access to patients who use more than 600 million prescriptions every year. Such a union would also transform Aetna from the primarily employer-based group insurance firm into one that focuses on individuals. The company will have to wade through significant regulatory hurdles and medical industry blowback in its quest. In May 2016, attendees at the American Hospital Association’s annual meeting warned that deals like the Aetna-Humana partnership would burden hospitals and consumers by giving insurance giants inordinate market power despite the companies’ promise to make significant divestitures. State insurance commissioners like California’s Dave Jones have also expressed deep skepticism about the merger in recent months. The question of whether or not to remain in Obamacare’s individual marketplaces has also weighed heavily on insurance companies in recent months, with UnitedHealth announcing that it would exit most statewide exchanges next year. Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini has taken a different tact, arguing his firm has “an obligation to stick it out and work with it until we know that it won’t work” and may even expand its Obamacare presence (the position puts him somewhat at odds with Humana’s recent pronouncement that the firm may ditch the health law marketplaces in some states after a 46% decline in quarterly profits)."
"The world’s largest delivery company has been beating analyst expectations recently–a big change from just two years ago when the company consistently under-delivered. Booming e-commerce continues to impact the company’s operations, leading to more residential delivery–though the company makes less money on home delivery than on fulfilling bulk business to business shipments. UPS last year acquired truck broker Coyote Logistics for $1.8 billion. More hubs and automation are giving the company runway for growth. On the other hand, a potential multi-billion-dollar pension fund obligation hangs over the company’s head, pending a U.S. Treasury ruling. Rivals like FedEx and, increasingly down the line, Amazon, pose threats to the business."
"Like its bigger rival Home Depot, home improvement retailer Lowe’s is benefitting big time from the ongoing housing boom. Household formation is up and millions of Americans are renovating their homes. Though Lowe’s has trailed its rival in terms of profitability, the company has been making big strides on other fronts, becoming one of the biggest beneficiaries of Sears’ shrinking appliance business and proving deft at winning the business of millennials. And Lowe’s looks to have snagged home improvement chain Rona in Canada, finally turning it into a serious player in that market overnight. Still, Lowe’s results have been choppy. And like Home Depot, a significant increase in interest rates would likely be bad for Lowe’s, potentially shutting the door on the housing boom and hurting sales as well."
"AIG’s C-suite faced a reckoning at the end of 2015 when four top executives left and CFO David Herzog retired. The management shakeup highlights the tensions between the firm and its investors, including activist Carl Icahn, and the company’s desire to make big changes to mollify shareholders. The struggles may not be ending anytime soon. AIG announced in May that it had missed profit estimates for a third consecutive quarter, with per-share earnings 35% off consensus estimates. Part of the battering came from continued exposure to hedge funds, which have been severely under-performing as of late. That’s led AIG to announce it’s pulling about 50% of the money it has allocated to hedge funds (so far, it has removed $4 billion). The question now is, how will the firm deal with activist investors like Icahn, who now owns about a 4% stake in the company and previously called for AIG to split up into three entities, and the U.S. government, which has deemed it a “systematically important financial institution” (or “too big to fail”). AIG can take solace in a recent federal court ruling that said MetLife shouldn’t be labeled TBTF."
"For Disney, 2015 was the year the Force awakened and investors freaked out over subscriber declines at flagship network ESPN. Fears over the effects of cord-cutting wreaked havoc on most media stocks last year, but the Mouse House’s media networks booked nearly as much revenue as Disney’s parks and resorts and film studio units combined. Overall, Disney has set new annual revenue records five years in a row and ended 2015 in style with the Star Wars franchise’s record-breaking return to the big screen with The Force Awakens. 0. 2016, the company has another full slate of blockbusters on tap, while Disneyland Shanghai finally opens its gates after years of anticipation. Meanwhile, investors’ cord-cutting fears have tempered a bit, though how to evolve the traditional television model still remains a major concern—and, now, Disney is once again seeking a successor to CEO Bob Iger, whose contract expires in 2018."
"The chipmaker missed the boat on mobile and is now trying to solidify its position as a supplier of the “new new” wave of computing: the so-called Internet of Things. That means it is making connected chips for anything from self-driving cars to jet engines. And it hasn’t entirely given up on mobile either. It was recently reported that Intel will supply up to 50% of the modems for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 7. Last November, the company landed another coup when it poached Murthy Renduchintala from Qualcomm to lead its newly-formed IoT division. But those wins haven’t been enough to stem the losses. Last year’s revenue came in at $55.4 billion, down 1% from the year before, with its PC and software groups seeing the biggest declines."
"Humana’s first quarter profit for 2016 plunged 46% thanks in part to continued struggles in its individual health insurance business (including in Obamacare’s statewide exchanges, some of which the company may exit) and a rise in medical-loss ratio, or the percentage of plan holders’ premiums used to finance medical services. Much of Humana’s prowess stems from its towering presence in the Medicare Advantage market, which represents 2.8 million of its accounts. The managed care insurance giant, which is being purchased by rival Aetna in a $37 billion deal set to close later this year, has been touting forward-looking projects such as “bundled payment” reimbursement models and a widespread initiative to boost community health in recent months. For instance, Humana announced an ambitious goal last year to improve the health of communities it serves through a bevy of integrated care experiments. That includes obesity reduction projects in counties like Bell County, Kentucky (among the most obese in the nation) which involve peer-to-peer counseling and nutritional education. While wellness programs’ long-term effectiveness has been questioned, Humana recently reported that an 8,000-person study of its own employees showed that the HumanaVitality initiative appreciably lowered hospital visits and unscheduled absences by participants–results the firm hopes to replicate among other plan holders next year."
"Pfizer will have to find a way to boost profits that doesn’t entail cutting its tax bill. In early 2016, the U.S. Treasury Department scuttled its planned inversion with Ireland-based Allergan, which would have moved the Big Pharma company’s headquarters overseas. The New York-based drug maker, which benefited from its blockbuster medication Lipitor before it went off patent, was hoping to reduce its tax rate through the $150 billion deal, which would have been the largest pharmaceutical merger in history. Instead, Pfizer will have to focus on reviving its core business, which has been in decline. The company’s sales dropped 1.5% in 2015 as it still deals with the impact of patent expirations on some of its biggest drugs. Its profits, meanwhile, fell nearly 24%, largely due to a surge in acquisition-related costs, which more than quintupled from the previous year due to Pfizer’s purchase of Hospira in early 2015. Pfizer’s stock fell 14.2% in 2015, a result of its performance as well as concerns that drug price regulation could hamper its profitability."
"Like other insurers, Prudential has been under intense earnings pressure because of low interest rates, making it hard for Prudential and others to make a return on their investments. Prudential’s earnings in the first quarter of 2016 fell 10% short of what analysts were expecting, and things don’t look likely to turnaround in the rest of the year. The company is the second largest U.S. insurer by assets, with 49,000 employees. And while it is based in New Jersey, about half of the company’s profits come from its Japanese operations."
"Networking technology giant Cisco has seen a lot of change in the past year. Long-time CEO and Silicon Valley luminary John Chambers became Cisco’s executive chairman, while Chuck Robbins, a high-ranking Cisco sales executive who Chambers once called an “execution machine,” took over as CEO. Chamber now leads a company that faces a rapidly changing technology industry in which more businesses seem to be buying less data center hardware and more cloud computing services from companies like Amazon and Microsoft. The rise of the cloud has put pressure on Cisco to expand beyond its legacy networking gear business, which still brings in billions of dollars each quarter. Over the past year, Cisco has made a series of high-profile acquisitions, including a $1.4 billion dollar purchase of Internet-of-things specialist Jasper Technologies and a $635 million dollar buyout of cybersecurity startup OpenDNS. Indeed, Cisco wants to capitalize on the hot fields of cybersecurity and the Internet of things, in which devices like factory robots and elevators can be connected to the web. The technology titan has made it clear it will spend big bucks on companies to ensure it can lead in those areas. Time will tell if those mega investments will pay off."
"Dow decided a year ago that it could no longer go it alone. In late 2015, it agreed to acquire long-time rival DuPont in a deal that will create a $120 billion company. But the deal making won’t stop there–after the merger, it plans to break the newly formed company into three separate companies, one focused on the seed and agricultural businesses, another on materials, and a third on so-called specialty materials, such as DuPont’s protective Kevlar products. The eventual goal — and hope — is that the restructurings will create companies that are big enough to dominate their fields but also remain focused. But it’s a huge undertaking and all that corporate shuffling can create integration risk. Marrying two companies and then breaking them up is bound to cause some disruption in Dow and DuPont’s multiple businesses. And to top it off, the global economic slowdown is already causing some pain at both companies in advance of the merger."
"In mid-2015, food distributor Sysco called off a planned $3.5 billion merger with U.S. Foods. Regulators killed the deal as the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit that said it would have given the combined company 75% of the national market for distribution services. The failed merger was hard to digest: Sysco had to pay a $300 million break-up fee to walk away from the agreement. And for the first nine months of 2016, sales were flat at $36.7 billion. Sysco also announced a three-year plan in February 2016 to cut 2% of its workforce and invest more aggressively in technology. U.S. Foods, meanwhile, pivoted with a recent initial public offering that raised around $1 billion."
"The logistics giant is riding the e-commerce wave. Smaller than its rival UPS, FedEx specializes in the less lucrative domain of express delivery. The company has an extensive footprint across the globe, including a driver network that boasts more than 100,000 vehicles. Last year the company picked up Dutch delivery company TNT Express for nearly $5 billion in a deal that boosts its presence in Europe. Investors got the jitters earlier this year when Amazon said it would lease 20 Boeing planes for an air cargo fleet, positioning itself as a possible competitor to FedEx down the line. However, shipping is a tough business that requires ample infrastructure and expertise, which FedEx has in spades."
"Bad news for global stability usually means good news at defense giants like Lockheed Martin. With the threat of terrorism and, as a result, military budgets on the rise, the company is enjoying a favorable outlook. One of Lockheed’s major moneymakers is its F-35 joint strike fighter jet, which accounts for a fifth of its business. The world’s largest defense contractor plans to ship 53 of them this year, up from 45 in 2015. Lockheed’s $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corporation last year has provided revenue lifts at the same time that the company offloads its government IT services business."
"After calling 2015 a “transition year,” the beverage giant struck a bullish tone in February 2016 when it said organic revenue for the year would rise 4% to 5%. It stuck to that target in April despite a more modest increase of just 2% for the first three months of the year. The problem? Wall Street analysts didn’t believe the company could hit that target, and they called out Coke’s top management. Wall Street doubts Coke can hit its 2016 revenue target. That put CEO Muhtar Kent, who saw his total 2015 pay slashed by 42%, on the defense. “We are confident, definitely, in the strategy and initiatives in place to support our growth targets over the course of the year,” Kent said in April. The soda industry’s sales are facing challenges in mature markets as consumers pivot to drinks they deem healthier. And while packaged water is selling strongly and Coke has made investments in startups and even recently made a big splashy launch into the milk category, soda remains a big sales driver. So for now, Coke remains highly dependent on convincing consumers to add soda to their shopping carts."
"Weakening economic growth in China and Brazil hit Caterpillar hard last year, as did lower global commodity prices. As a result, the big machine manufacturer suffered big losses, slipping down five spots on this year’s Fortune 500 list. At $47 billion, its 2015 sales were down nearly 15% from the year before. Lower oil prices were particularly painful, sending orders for machines that support oil drilling and well servicing down close to 90% from the year before. But there are potential bright spots: The 91-year-old company is investing in predictive analytics offerings, connecting their machines with data-gathering sensors, and partnering with tech players to create new revenue streams."
"Another quarter, another revenue slide for the tech behemoth. Indeed, IBM recently reported its sixteenth straight quarter of declining sales, which puts CEO Ginni Rometty in a tough spot with investors. The long-time IBMer is trying to shift the attention to the 104-year-old company’s newer businesses: cloud computing, mobility, analytics, and security as well as bold partnerships and acquisitions. (Its latest splurge was on data company Truven Health Analytics, which it is buying for $2.6 billion.) But the growth hasn’t been enough to offset the massive declines in Big Blue’s traditional businesses. Last year’s revenue, which came in at $82.5 billion, represented a more than 12% drop from the year before."
"The Nashville-based hospital chain is the nation’s largest and it has benefited from the Affordable Care Act in recent years–namely, by the increased number of insured patients seeking healthcare. HCA’s revenues jumped 8.7% and profits 13.5% in 2015, due to increased admissions–ER visits climbed 8% across the enterprise–as well as increased revenue per admission. Executives have warned the Obamacare boost won’t last much longer. Also worrying to investors: the creeping cost of labor and the rise in uninsured patient visits."
"In 1996, Nashville’s renowned Ingram family helped take the electronics and information technology distributor Ingram Micro public on the New York Stock Exchange. Now 20 years later, the Ingram family aims to sell its last remaining shares of Ingram Micro as the Chinese conglomerate HNA Group plans to buy the supply chain company for $6 billion. The deal, announced in February 2016, is the latest in a series of big acquisitions involving Chinese business consortiums wanting to bulk up on foreign companies and investments while China’s economy slows. After the deal closes, which is expected in the later half of 2016, Ingram Micro will become a subsidiary of Tianjin Tianhai Investment Company, itself a subsidiary of HNA Group, and its headquarters will remain in Irvine, California. HNA Group said that Ingram Micro will be the conglomerate’s biggest business in terms of revenue and will help it expand internationally."
"For a second consecutive year, New York Life Insurance’s managed assets soared past $500 billion in 2015—and that wasn’t the only highlight in the mutual life insurance behemoth’s most recent annual report. The firm also brought in a record $1.3 billion in sales, is planning a record $1.7 billion dividend payout to policyholders in 2016, and achieved operating earnings of $1.9 billion (second only to its record $2.02 billion in 2014 operating earnings). New York Life, along with AIG, also sold an industry-topping $3 billion in fixed annuities in the first quarter of 2016. Analysts from Limra expect sales in the fixed annuity market to continue spiking in the face of market volatility."
"Tyson’s 2014 purchase of Hillshire Brands for nearly $8 billion has paid off big time for the largest meatpacking company in the U.S. The additions of brands like Jimmy Dean, Ball Park, and Sara Lee helped Tyson hit record earnings in its prepared foods business last fiscal year. Profits at the company overall were up 41%. The Hillshire deal is part of the company’s strategy to focus on less commoditized products, an approach that also led to record earnings in its chicken operation. Tyson had a tough year in beef due to tight supply for cattle, which has led the company to cut back on its beef processing operations. Tyson is increasingly looking abroad for growth, although its chicken production in China took a hit as economic growth there slowed."
"Energy Transfer Equity is an oil and gas pipeline empire built by billionaire Kelcy Warren with a spate of M&A deals (Sunoco, Southern Union) that paid off handsomely during the shale boom. At the start of the year, it had a network of around 71,000 miles of pipelines pumping natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, and crude oil. But Warren’s luck ran out last year with a miscalculated approach for Williams Companies, just as the oil price crash took its toll on the ‘midstream’ segment. ETE persuaded Williams to sell itself in September, but the value of both companies has tumbled since then. ETE originally agreed to pay $32.6 billion, including $6 billion in cash and the rest in ETE shares. Today, Williams is worth only $16 billion, and ETE is struggling to raise the cash after a sharp decline in its own share price. A bitter and complex legal battle has ensued. Williams, which originally refused Kelcy’s advances, is now suing to force the merger through, and to reverse an issue of convertible debt by ETE that would dilute its shareholders’ stake in the combined company."
"American staged an extraordinary comeback by shrinking its costs in bankruptcy, then greatly expanding its domestic network by merging with U.S. Airways. That combination capped the historic wave of consolidation to create the world’s largest carrier. Under CEO Doug Parker, American’s profits are still waxing: In the first quarter of 2016, operating income rose 9.8%, aided by an almost 30% drop in fuel costs. Still, the tailwinds that propelled American to record earnings are beginning to wane. Though Americans are still flying in record numbers, the steep fall in fuel oil prices, and the robust earnings it produced, has emboldened both major and ultra-low-cost carriers to offer a lot more seats on high-traffic routes, pushing down fares. Many of those new seats are taking flight in American’s best markets. In late 2014, a ban that prevented Southwest from flying most long-haul routes from Dallas’ Love Field was lifted. Since then, Southwest has be offering bargain fares to big cities from American’s home market, and ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit is luring budget travelers as well, forcing American to follow suit on prices. The depression in Brazil and chaos in Venezuela are hitting its big Latin American business. In the first quarter, American’s revenues slipped 4% from the same period in 2015, and its revenue for each seat flown fell 7.5%. Times are still good for American, but a new era of sustained profitability matching the recent peaks is far from certain."
"Johnson Controls saw a revenue decrease of around 4% in fiscal year 2015, due mostly to a deconsolidation of the company’s auto interiors business and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. The company is focusing on growth technologies in 2016 and plans to spin off its auto seating and interiors business in October 2016. The new company will be called Advent and will be a completely separate publicly traded company, listed on the NYSE. Furthermore, it also plans to merge with Tyco, a fire and security provider based in Ireland."
"Best Buy has defied expectations it could thrive in an era of online shopping. Through moves like creating areas that focus on such product categories as smart homes; partnering with Apple; and overhauling its tech-assistance Geek Squad services business, Best Buy has managed to keep stores relevant. Still, the retailer has been slammed by low TV prices and softness in the mobile phone sales, resulting in a weak holiday season in 2015, again raising questions about how long it can keep fending off Amazon. In the meantime, Best Buy continues to try new things, like shop in shops at some Macy’s stores."
"In February, Delta made the surprise announcement that CEO Richard Anderson would retire years at age 61, ending the reign of the top leader in the industry’s revival. It was Anderson who orchestrated the successful merger with Northwest in 2008, nurtured the best labor relations in the business, and built a premium brand in skies where a seat is mainly a commodity. His successor––Anderson remains executive chairman––is former president and Anderson’s long-time lieutenant Ed Bastian, who’s sworn to maintain Delta’s industry-leading performance in the top metrics for consumer service, including on-time arrivals and fewest cancellations. Delta boasts the most lucrative mix of traffic among the Big Four because it attracts the highest proportion of business passengers paying premium fares. In the first quarter, for example, its revenues for every seat flown one mile easily topped the figure for of its rivals. Still, Delta’s revenues fell 4% in Q1, hit by flagging demand in Europe and Asia. That’s not stopping Bastian from pursuing Anderson’s long-term strategy of expanding in the foreign with the greatest potential for growth––a pursuit that’s leading Delta to establish a major hub in Shanghai."
"Goldman Sachs’ business model is not as precious as it used to be. CEO Lloyd Blankfein, back after a bout with cancer, is embarking on a cost cutting effort. At the same time the bank is changing its long-held focus on the top tiers of corporate America, and the 1%. It recently announced a plan to start an internet bank that caters to middle income Americans. Goldman also in early 2016 bought a company that manages 401(k) plans for small businesses. All of those moves will hopefully boost Goldman’s profitability, which is still way below where it was before the financial crisis."
"The 8.3 magnitude earthquake in Chile and resulting floods hit Liberty Mutual hard in 2015. Profits at the property and casual insurance company sunk 72% due in part to higher losses from catastrophe claims, both in Chile as well as other parts of the world. The Boston-based insurer also invests in energy projects including oil and gas wells, but those investments have fared poorly as energy prices have fallen, contributing to Liberty Mutual’s earnings declines. The 104-year-old company’s revenues also fell nearly 1% in 2015, though it still managed to climb five spots on the Fortune 500, to No. 73."
"The property and casual insurer has continued its transition to a single Nationwide brand for all its subsidiaries. So far the consolidation is paying off. Revenues increased 11% last year, and profits jumped nearly 35%. The boost was in part due to its financial services arm. That business benefited from booming sales of life insurance and retirement plans, as well as an expansion in the assets under management. Assets in Nationwide’s mutual funds and retirement plans have ballooned during the ongoing bull market, surpassing $210 billion at the end of last year. That’s generating higher fees for the Columbus, Ohio-based company. As a result, Nationwide rose 16 spots on the Fortune 500, to No. 69 on this year’s list."
"Revenue for the 165-year-old drug maker slid 6.5% in 2015 largely due to currency fluctuations and divestitures. In the U.S., sales grew on the strong performance of its diabetes and cancer medications and as a result of its $8.3 billion acquisition of antibiotic maker Cubist Pharmaceuticals. The company also pressed ahead with restructuring efforts–it shed 2,000 jobs in 2015–and kept pace in the industry immunotherapy race, with the widening range of approved uses for Keytruda, Merck’s breakthrough immuno-oncology drug."
"Since taking charge in 2002, Dave Cote has built one of the world’s most successful industrial conglomerates by making roughly ninety opportunistic acquisitions in such diverse fields as hand-held scanners, gas detection equipment, and such protective gear, notably firemen’s helmets and boots. In early 2015, Cote veered from that deliberate strategy to launch a $90 billion bid for rival United Technologies. Anti-trust issues, and complaints from Boeing and Airbus, who wanted to keep both suppliers as competitors, killed the campaign. Since then, Cote has excelled at his regular practice of buying mundane-sounding industrial businesses, then strongly improving their profitability. Last year, he plowed $5.8 billion into new deals, including the purchase of German gas meter-maker Elster. He’s juggling divestitures as well, unveiling a plan to spin off the resins and chemicals business. The Cote treatment still works: In 2015, Honeywell delivered its sixth straight year of double-digit increases in EPS. His contract expires in late 2017, but it’s certain that shareholders would love to see the GE veteran stay on the job."
"Morgan Stanley has put money management ahead of investment banking since the financial crisis in an effort to make the firm more stable in the next economic downturn. The move may have made the Wall Street firm less risky. But it also made it less profitable. Analysts have been questioning whether the company can break into the double digits on return on equity, a widely watched measure of profitability on Wall Street. In order to get there, CEO James Gorman has been cutting costs, most recently by firing more bond traders in an effort to help the bottom line without hurting sales too much. Gorman will need to get the formula right soon or he could find himself following those bond traders out the door as well."
"After growing its financial advisor network to 5,800 last year, MassMutual has continued expanding its workforce. In February, it bought rival MetLife’s network of 4,000 life insurance agents for $300 million. That expansion appears to be paying off. Sales jumped 14% last year, pushing MassMutual up 18 spots on the Fortune 500. Still, low interest rates and market volatility contributed to a slight decline in the insurance company’s assets under management and fee income from overseeing those funds. Overall, though, profits rose 7% for the Springfield, Mass.-based company, not a bad performance in a tough market for insurers."
"The health insurer–the fifth largest in the U.S.–agreed last year to be acquired by its rival Anthem for $48.4 billion. The move should give the combined company greater scale and help it cut costs, something that is sorely needed, particularly now as the Affordable Care Act has eaten into profits across the industry. While Cigna, like its peers, has had to deal with high medical expenses from its newly insured customers since the health care law went into effect, the impact on the company has been minimal: Cigna’s individual health plans, which were sold on ObamaCare exchanges in eight states in 2015, only represent 1% of its total medical insurance company’s customers. Although the company’s CEO said late last year that it hasn’t made any money on its ACA business so far, Cigna’s profits only declined very slightly in 2015, and its revenues rose 8.5%. It is still waiting on U.S. regulators to approve its deal with Anthem, and it is unclear how long that will take, given increased federal scrutiny of M&A."
"Since United and Continental merged in 2010, the carrier struggled to integrate the two divergent cultures and workforces. As a result, it’s lagging its three major rivals in customer service and profitability. Add to the crosswinds management and board upheaval. Late last year, a scandal forced the resignation of CEO Jeff Smisek, who was replaced by former railroad executive Oscar Munoz. After a month on the job, Munoz suffered a massive heart attack, and returned in February to face a proxy battle from disgruntled hedge funds. In April, Munoz forged a compromise, agreeing to serve under a new chairman from outside the board, Robert Milton, former CEO of Air Canada. On the plus side, the sharp drop in fuel costs, and improved on-time performance, swelled its earnings from $2.4 billion in 2014 to $5.2 billion last year. But income slumped in the first quarter because of widespread pressure on prices—pressure that’s likely to persist. Frontier and Alaska Airlines, for example, are adding seats, and luring customers with discount fares, at United’s hubs in Denver and San Francisco."
"While cheap gas and a healthier economy has been good for consumers, it has been bad for Allstate. The auto insurer has had to cover the damage in an increasing number of car accidents as those consumers hit the road more often. While the trend has hurt property and casual insurance companies across the spectrum—more economic activity generally leads to higher claims—it has particularly impacted Allstate. Its profits plunged nearly 25% in 2015. Shares of the Northbrook, lll.-based insurer fell 14% last year as the disappointing statistics, and signs that cheap oil and an improving economy would continue, prompted a drop in confidence from investors."
"Most companies in the commodities business have had a terrible time of late, as forces from the flagging Chinese economy to weak demand in the developed world have conspired to drag the Dow Jones commodities index down more than 17% in the past year. But INTL FCStone, the financial services company that specializes in commodity trading, has been able to profit even during the bust, mostly due to the fact that it doesn’t take directional positions in the assets it trades. The firm reported a 12% jump in profits in the second quarter of 2016, driven by strength in its commercial hedging segment."
"Profits for the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, which manages retirement accounts and mutual funds, and sells insurance plans, jumped 26% in 2015. A big boost came from its acquisition of Nuveen investments the year before. The organization has won accolades for the best-in-class investment performance of its funds, which has helped attract more customers and management fees. TIAA has also expanded its offerings in other types of investment classes such as real estate, agriculture, and timber. Sales increased nearly 3% in 2015, helping to push it up 10 spots on the Fortune 500, to No. 82."
"One of the most storied brands in the financial services industry, American Express has fallen on hard times of late. In 2015, the company announced that it would be ending its 16-year exclusive relationship with mega-retailer Costco, a big hit considering 1 in 10 Amex cards were issued by the wholesaler. The firm has also had to reduce its prices to small merchants and beef up the rewards it offers its customers to hold its own in a highly competitive credit card landscape. Nonetheless, American Express was able to beat revenue estimates in the first quarter of 2016, in part on the strength of its loyal corporate business."
"The largest farmer- and rancher-owned cooperative in the U.S. with $34.6 billion in sales provides the stuff farmers need to grow crops–fuel and farm supplies–and then buys growers’ harvests to either sell or process. CHS saw its profits drop nearly 28% as its agriculture segment took a hit from the reduced selling prices of grain. The cooperative’s energy segment, which also refines and retails petroleum, suffered from a 28% drop in the price of refined fuels and weak demand for propane due to a warm winter. The company took a charge for ending development on a planned nitrogen fertilizer plant and instead decided to make the biggest investment in its history ($2.8 billion) in an existing fertilizer operation."
"The defense giant has been benefiting from a wave of increased geopolitical tension and military spending. Demand for the company’s Gulfstream jetliner has recently softened; it projects delivering 138 this year compared to 147 in 2015. General Dynamics is making up for the commercial revenue decline on its defense side. Navy spending is up, which has boosted the company’s marine systems sales. Overseas deals for armored vehicles in the UK, Denmark, and Saudi Arabia have boosted its combat systems unit as well. Last year the company spun off Fideleis Cybersecurity, a computer security business that it picked up in 2012. The move demonstrates CEO Phebe Novakovic’s continued emphasis on slimming and restructuring the organization."
"The California-based biotech continued its rocket-like ascent in 2015–just two years ago it ranked No. 250 on the 500–due to booming sales of its breakthrough Hepatitis C medications. Those drugs–Sovaldi and Harvoni–which cost a fortune, but also cure a chronic, devastating disease, sparked a national debate on drug pricing. They also drove Gilead’s bottom and top lines in 2015–revenues and profits jumped 31% and 50%, respectively. John Milligan, Gilead’s new CEO faces rockier road in 2016: the competition is stiffer and IP challenges and pricing pressures loom."
"Much like almost every other tech company more than a decade old, Oracle continues to navigate in the tricky new world of cloud-deployed software. Recently, Oracle has been buying companies that have expertise in delivering software from their own servers on a subscription basis. That’s a big change from selling databases for an upfront fee that run on customer servers and are updated every few years. But as serious as Oracle has been about adding new business software, its ace-in-the-hole remains its flagship database. Now Oracle offers more than one way to deploy it. On a March 2016 earnings call, execs said 350,000 customers run Oracle’s database in-house, but that any number may start moving some of that work to Oracle’s cloud infrastructure. The risk is that they can also run Oracle databases on Amazon and Microsoft clouds, and that those two clouds offer other database choices. Oracle claims big gains in cloud-related software sales but it’s unclear if and when they will offset declining sales of old-style (but very profitable) software licenses."
"For the past eight years, the 80-year old privately held super market chain in six Southeastern states and based in Lakeland, Fla. has been on a slow growth trajectory under CEO Ed Crenshaw, who semi-retired in May 2016 but will continue as chairman. He hands the reins of the world’s largest employee-owned company over to Todd Jones, a lifelong Publix associate and the first non-family member to lead it. Jones inherits a retail brand that is as loved by generations of faithful shoppers as it is by its 180,000 employees, who are also co-owners via a very healthy stock ownership plan. Jones will also oversee Publix’s further expansion as it plans to open stores in Virginia in 2017. Also read: Bag Boy Confidential: My Five Days as a Publix Employee"
"The world’s largest athletic apparel and gear maker’s 2015 can best be described in one word: dominant. Fiscal-year sales climbed to $30.6 billion from $27.8 billion as Americans and shoppers around the globe continue to be lured by the trendy swoosh. Nike’s gear is widely seen on courts and running trails, but the brand also has remained on-trend as part of the growing consumer interest in “athleisure” — a term that describes the growing acceptance of wearing athletic apparel and shoes just about anywhere. Nike is bullish about what’s ahead, projecting $50 billion in sales by 2020 due to a global shift toward fitness and significant growth from the women’s business, Jordan brand, and e-commerce sales. There’s a short-term advantage on the horizon: the Summer Olympics in Brazil will generate increased attention for athletic companies like Nike, which can springboard the event to sell more new, innovative gear."
"In a bleak environment for retail, the parent company of Marshalls, T.J. Maxx, and HomeGoods has continued to dominate the landscape. TJX sells an ever-changing assortment of branded goods at discounted prices — a formula that’s become increasingly appealing to value-oriented shoppers and has led to some copycat attempts from the likes of Macy’s and Nordstrom. Sales were up 6.4% for the year as the off-price retailer with more than 3,600 stores crossed the $30 billion in sales threshold, buoyed by strong performances in home goods, jewelry and accessories, and active wear. Same-store sales were up 5%, driven by higher customer traffic. The company continued its push internationally with the acquisition of Australian chain Trade Secret. E-commerce still remains an insignificant piece of the business, making up just 1% of the company’s total sales. TJX’s fiscal year ending January 30, 2016 marked the end of an era with CEO Carol Meyrowitz, who had an impressive run at the company since 2007. Earlier this year, she handed the CEO reins to Ernie Herrman, but will stay on as the company’s executive chairman for three years."
"ConocoPhillips is the smallest of the U.S.’s big three oil and gas producers, and 2016 seems to be the year it admitted it won’t get any bigger. Spinning off its refining and marketing operations into Phillips Petroleum has left it without a downstream hedge against low crude prices, causing a string of write-downs and quarterly losses. After a credit rating downgrade in April, CEO Ryan Lance made cutting the company’s $25 billion debt pile top priority, which suggests it won’t be heading to the bankruptcy courts with a glint in its eye in search of bargains in the shale sector. Nearly 10% of its production is bitumen, which requires expensive processing before it can be transported and sold. That means it’s squarely in harm’s way in the battle for market share being waged by low-cost OPEC producers. However, crude prices are now back above the $45 a barrel level where the company thinks it can sustain a dividend without taking on more debt."
"Diversified products conglomerate 3M saw a slight drop in net income in 2016, but has a five-year plan to increase earnings-per-share by between 8 and 11 percent by 2020. The Minnesota-based company recently opened a new science center where it plans to work on new innovations across its all of its business divisions. The diversity of the product offerings from 3M is truly impressive; the company makes everything rom Scotch tape and Command adhesives to Post-It notes to home organization products, not to mention specialized products for industries ranging from orthodontistry to aerospace engineering."
"The global snacking giant has reported sharply lower sales in recent quarters, with results stung by two issues: a strong U.S. dollar has ate into the company’s top line and the loss of Mondelez’s coffee brands after it sold them to create a new company called Jacobs Douwe Egberts. Mondelez still has a noncontrolling stake in the new company, but the loss of the business has helped contribute to double-digit revenue declines in recent quarters. This year, Mondelez is only targeting net organic revenue growth of at least 2%, conceding that a challenging macroeconomic environment will result in slower growth for the global $1.2 trillion snacking market. Mondelez is planning to focus on so-called “power brands,” which include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, Cadbury chocolate, and Trident gum, while also eliminating less profitable lines to help simplify the company’s supply chain."
"Exelon is the country’s largest electric holding company, having closed its contentious $6.8 billion takeover of Pepco Holdings in March after months of haggling with regulators that forced it to sweeten the deal with $430 million in exceptional payments. Exelon, which was born out of a merger in 2000 between Unicom and PECO, operates 23 nuclear reactors across the North-East and Midwest. These represent some 60% of its generating capacity (the rest is either fossil fuel-burning or renewable) and were the main source of its earnings until collapsing oil prices and subsidies for renewables started to undermine wholesale power prices. They’re now looking increasingly challenged: the company is threatening to close efficient nuclear plants in Illinois if local lawmakers don’t vote through a bill that would compensate them for the zero-carbon quality of their energy. The costs for nuclear decommissioning are likely to rise in the medium- to long-term, whatever the fate of the Illinois bill. Against this backdrop, the company is looking to source up to half of its profits from regulated businesses operating grids and serving end consumers (as with the Pepco deal), seeing these as a more stable source of income."
"For a while, World Fuel Services boasted the fastest revenue growth in the Fortune 500 over a 10-year period — faster even than Apple. The drop in oil prices since late 2014 led to a 25% decline in revenue in 2015, however, with profits falling by a little less. WFS specializes in the generally unloved, low-margin business of selling fuel to shipping companies and airlines. Although revenue fell again in the first quarter of 2016, profit margins were stable due to strong demand from airlines. WFS also transports crude oil by rail. Last year, it agreed to pay $110 million into a compensation fund for victims of the Lac Megantic disaster in Quebec in 2013, when a train carrying its crude derailed and exploded, killing 47 people and devastating the small town."
"The top maker of agricultural machinery is taking a page from Silicon Valley, investing in mobile apps that let farmers monitor the spacing between seeds and connecting its iconic green tractors and combines with sensors that detect when a machine needs to be repaired or replaced. The new focus on tech is an effort to fight slumping sales. But it’s an uphill battle. Falling crop prices have put a massive dent in Deere’s sales, which came in at $28.9 billion in 2015, 20% down from the year before. What’s worse, the company expects that 2016 will be even worse for the farming business."
"CEO Ellen Kullman lost her battle with activist shareholders and ultimately was replaced by Edward Breen, who will oversee the company’s merger with Dow Chemical (No. 56 on this year’s Fortune 500) and which is expected to close by late 2016."
"Tesoro is one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and marketers in the country, operating six refineries in California, Alaska, Washington, North Dakota, and Utah, with a combined refining capacity of 875,000 barrels a day. Its network of 2,300 retail stations includes those under the brands of Shell, Exxon, Mobil, USA Gasoline and ARCO, as well as its own brand. In January, it closed the acquisition of Great Northern Midstream, an operator of oil pipelines and storage in North Dakota. Under pressure from a squeeze in margins early in 2016, it has pushed back the completion of a $460 million program to integrate its two California refineries. That project also faces some stiff opposition from environmental campaigners and is still awaiting approval from state regulators, as of May 2016."
"This distributor and retailer of tech components and IT services was founded in 1921 and is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona."
"It was an eventful year for the family of the man who turned FOX into a media empire. Rupert Murdoch stepped down from his role as CEO of 21st Century Fox in July, handing the reins to his son, James, while remaining executive chairman. It was an initiation by fire into the CEO role, as Fox suffered through the same late-2015 stock volatility as its Big Media rivals, thanks to market fears over the effects of cord-cutting on traditional television companies. Fox also faced a drop-off in revenue from its film unit after last year’s offerings failed to live up to the company’s blockbuster 2014. The company then kicked off the current year by offering voluntary buyouts as a means to cut $250 million from its film and TV units. The good news for Fox is that the film unit scored a surprise hit with the raunchy superhero Deadpool, while the company’s cable news networks have banked record ratings thanks to the political circus of the 2016 presidenital election cycle."
"It was a banner year for the Milwaukee-based life insurer, which logged 20% profit growth and record revenues in 2015. The firm’s assets reached $239 billion, another record. Northwestern Mutual, which distributes a dividend to policyholders each year, also continued to expand its financial planning business with the acquisition of LearnVest, a Millennial-friendly start-up offering financial advice online."
"Traditional media stocks suffered a bout of volatility in 2015, as investors reacted to concerns that audiences’ cord-cutting trends would soon upend the entire television industry. As a result, Time Warner watched its stock tumble by nearly 25% for the year. That drop-off came despite the fact that Time Warner’s biggest division, its Turner networks, actually saw higher ad and subscription revenues last year, even as subscribers dipped. Investors’ fears have cooled a bit and CEO Jeff Bewkes seems confident that Time Warner is prepared to compete on the digital front-lines—especially since the company took a big step into the streaming fray with its HBO Now app attracting 800,000 subscribers in its first six months. Looking ahead, Time Warner’s networks look to receive boosts from a particularly frothy 2016 election cycle, even as rumors continue to mount that investors are clamoring for an HBO spin-off or a sale of the entire company."
