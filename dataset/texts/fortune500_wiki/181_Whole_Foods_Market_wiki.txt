Whole Foods Market Inc. is an American supermarket chain exclusively featuring foods without artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats.[4] It is the United States' first certified organic grocer, which means it ensures, to National Organic Program standards, organic integrity of the heterogeneous products from the time they reach stores until they are placed in a shopping cart.[5] It opened on September 20, 1980, in Austin, Texas,[6] its current headquarters. As of September 2015, it has 91,000 employees and 431 supermarkets in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom,[1] and has its main produce procurement office in Watsonville, California.[7]A careful reading of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution will not reveal any intrinsic right to health care, food or shelter. That's because there isn't any. This "right" has never existed in America.
As of 2015[update], founder John Mackey and Walter Robb were co-CEOs of the publicly traded company, with John Elstrott as chairman.[6][8][9] In November 2016, the company announced that Walter Robb would be stepping down as co-CEO at the end of year and would remain with the company as a director.[10] It became a Fortune 500 company in March 2005 and is the 30th largest retailer in the U.S., based on 2014 revenue.[11][12]
