The company provides satellite television, satellite Internet access, audio programming, and interactive television services to commercial and residential customers in the United States.

In January 2008, Dish Network was spun off from its former parent company EchoStar, which was founded by Charlie Ergen as a satellite television equipment distributor in 1980.[2] The company began using Dish Network as its consumer brand in March 1997,[citation needed] after the successful launch of its first satellite, EchoStar I, in December 1995.[5][6] That launch marked the beginning of its subscription television services, and EchoStar has since launched numerous satellites, with nine owned and leased satellites in its fleet as of January 2013. EchoStar continues to be the primary technology partner to Dish Network.
Joseph Clayton became president and chief executive officer of the company in June 2011,[7] while Charlie Ergen remained chairman. Clayton remained in the position until March 31, 2015 when he retired leaving Ergen to resume the post.[8] Ergen has said diversifying and updating technology for the company will be a high priority, with an expectation that, over the coming decade, the company will provide internet, video, and telephone service for both home and mobile applications.[9]
