Entergy v. Riverkeeper, 556 U.S. 208 (2009), is a decision by the United States Supreme Court that reviewed the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) interpretation of the Clean Water Act regulations with regard to cooling water intakes for power plants. Existing facilities are mandated to use the "Best Technology Available" to "minimize the adverse environmental impact."[1] The importance of this case is whether the agency may use a costâ€“benefit analysis (CBA) in choosing the Best Technology Available also known in the industry as Best Available Technology or (BAT) to meet the National performance standards (NPS). Reversing a lower court opinion, in a 5 - 1 - 3 ruling the court decided to uphold EPA's decision as reasonable to allow CBA when determining BAT to maintain national environmental standards.[1]
