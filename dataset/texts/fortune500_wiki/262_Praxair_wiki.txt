Praxair, Inc. is an American worldwide industrial gases company. It is the largest industrial gases company in North and South America, and the third-largest worldwide by revenue.
The company was originally founded by Carl von Linde as Linde Air Products Company in 1907. In 1917, it joined with 4 other chemical companies under the name Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation, while maintaining a separate identity.[1] Its degree of independence waxed and waned over the years, and in 1989, it was spun off as a subsidiary, Union Carbide Industrial Gases Inc., and renamed to Praxair when it became a formally independent company three years later.[2] The name is derived from a combination of the Greek word "praxis", or practical application, and "air", the company's primary raw material.[citation needed]
Praxair was the first company in North America to commercialize cryogenically separated oxygen.[citation needed] The company introduced the first distribution system for liquid gas in 1917 and developed on-site gas supply in the 1940s.[citation needed] In the 1960s, Praxair introduced non-cryogenic means of air separation.[citation needed]
In August 2016 it was publicly announced that the American company was in official negotiations to merger with the German competitor Linde Group, which would form the world's largest gas supplier.[3][4][5][6] The following month in September the negotiations were halted and suspended indefinitely.[7][8][9][10] As of mid December of 2016 Praxair has resumed negotiations with Linde for a potential merger [11][12][13][14][15] In late December an official announcement was made that Praxair has reached an agreement to merger with Linde in a deal valued at $35 billion.[16]
