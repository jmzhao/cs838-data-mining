ADP, LLC., is an American provider of human resources management software and services. ADP was formerly one of four American companies to get a AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's,[2][3] but S&P and Moody's downgraded ADP to AA in April 2014, after the dealer services unit spin off.[4]
