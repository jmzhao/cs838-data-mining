Sonic Guest Experience is a service concept for Sonic Automotive created under the leadership of CEO Scott Smith.
Under this service model, customers are matched with a dedicated Experience Guide for the entire buying process. Since the pricing is set using fair market value, consumers do not need to negotiate and car buying times are reduced with this model to one hour or less.
Sonic performs on-site appraisals for trade-ins and sales to the dealership, during which actual market value is determined.
Sonic Guest Experience is currently available at five Charlotte, NC area locations. The concept will roll out to additional locations in 2017.
