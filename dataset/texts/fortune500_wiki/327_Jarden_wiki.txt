Jarden was a U.S. consumer products company. Formed by the spin-out of Ball Corporation's canning business, the company became a wider conglomerate of consumer brands, particularly in the outdoors and home appliances market.
Jarden was acquired in 2016 by Newell Rubbermaid, which renamed itself Newell Brands.
