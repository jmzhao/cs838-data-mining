Xerox Corporation /ˈzɪərɒks/ (also known as Xerox, stylized as xerox since 2008, and previously as XEROX from 1960 to 2008) is an American global corporation that sells document solutions and services, and document technology products in more than 160 countries.[3] Xerox is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut (moved from Stamford, Connecticut in October 2007),[4] though its largest population of employees is based around Rochester, New York, the area in which the company was founded. The company purchased Affiliated Computer Services for $6.4 billion in early 2010.[5] As a large developed company, it is consistently placed in the list of Fortune 500 companies. On Jan. 29, 2016, Xerox announced its plans to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies – Xerox Corporation, which will comprise the company’s Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses, and Conduent Incorporated, a business process services company. Xerox completed the separation of Conduent Incorporated (NYSE: CNDT) effective on Dec. 31, 2016, creating two market-leading, publicly- traded companies. Under the terms of the separation, on the distribution date of Dec. 31, 2016, Xerox shareholders received one share of Conduent common stock for every five shares of Xerox common stock they held as of the close of business on Dec. 15, 2016, the record date for the distribution. In connection with the spin-off, Xerox received a cash transfer from Conduent of $1.8 billion, which it intends to use, along with cash on hand, to retire approximately $2.0 billion in debt. Xerox continues to trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “XRX”.Xerox Tower in Rochester, New York served as headquarters in 1968–1969Stamford, Connecticut served as headquarters from 1969 to 2007Former manufacturing facility in Henrietta, New York, constructed in the 1960s and sold to Harris RF Communications in 2010.Xerox Canada Head Office at North American Life Centre (Xerox Tower), North York, Ontario
Researchers at Xerox and its Palo Alto Research Center invented several important elements of personal computing, such as the desktop metaphor GUI, the computer mouse[6] and desktop computing.[7] These concepts were frowned upon by the then board of directors, who ordered the Xerox engineers to share them with Apple technicians. The concepts were adopted by Apple and, later, Microsoft. With the help of these innovations, Apple and Microsoft came to dominate the personal computing revolution of the 1980s, whereas Xerox was not a major player.[8]
