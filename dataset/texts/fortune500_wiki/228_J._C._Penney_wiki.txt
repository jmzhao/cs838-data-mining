The J. C. Penney Company, doing business as JCPenney, is a department store with 1,014 locations[1] in 49 U.S. states and Puerto Rico.[5] In addition to selling conventional merchandise, JCPenney stores often house several leased departments such as Sephora, Seattle's Best Coffee, salons, optical centers, portrait studios, and jewelry repair.During my time on the JCPenney Board of Directors, I have always advocated for what I believe to be in the best interests of the Companyâ€”its stockholders, employees and others. At this time, I believe that the addition of two new directors and my stepping down from the Board is the most constructive way forward for JCPenney and all other parties involved.[42]Penney's logo used from 1963 to 1971.Current JCPenney logo,[56] originally used from 1971 to 2011 and reintroduced in 2013.Alternate JCPenney logo used on a few stores, used from 2011 until 2012.JCPenney logo used from 2012 until 2014 [57]
Most JCPenney stores are located in suburban shopping malls. Before 1966, most of its stores were located in downtown areas. As shopping malls became more popular during the latter half of the 20th century, JCPenney followed the trend by relocating and developing stores to anchor the malls. In more recent years, the chain has continued to follow consumer traffic, echoing the retailing trend of opening some freestanding stores, including some next door to competitors. Certain stores are located in power centers. The company has been an Internet retailer since 1998. It has streamlined its catalog and distribution while undergoing renovation improvements at store level.
