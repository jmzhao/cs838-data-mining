The United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:Â X), more commonly known as U.S. Steel, is an American integrated steel producer with major production operations in the United States, Canada, and Central Europe. The company was the world's 15th largest steel producer in 2014.
The company was renamed USX Corporation in 1986 and back to United States Steel Corporation in 2001 when the company spun off the oil & gas business of Marathon Oil and the steel business of U.S. Steel to shareholders. In 2001 it was still the largest domestically owned integrated steel producer in the United States, although it produced only slightly more steel than it did in 1902, after significant downsizing in the 1980s.[2]
