{Praxair, Inc.} is an American worldwide industrial gases company. It is the largest industrial gases company in North and South America, and the third-largest worldwide by revenue.
The company was originally founded by Carl von Linde as {Linde Air Products Company} in 1907. In 1917, it joined with 4 other chemical companies under the name {Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation}, while maintaining a separate identity.[1] Its degree of independence waxed and waned over the years, and in 1989, it was spun off as a subsidiary, {Union Carbide Industrial Gases Inc}., and renamed to {Praxair} when it became a formally independent company three years later.[2] The name is derived from a combination of the Greek word "praxis", or practical application, and "air", the company's primary raw material.[citation needed]
