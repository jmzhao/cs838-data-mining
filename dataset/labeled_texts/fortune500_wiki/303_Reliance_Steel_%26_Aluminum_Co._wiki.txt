{Reliance Steel and Aluminum Co.} ({RSAC}) (NYSE:Â RS), is a Fortune 500 company and the largest metals service center (MSC) corporation in North America.[2] Headquartered in Los Angeles, California, {Reliance} operates hundreds of metals service centers globally. It provides metals processing services and distributes a line of approximately 50,000 metal products, including aluminum, brass, alloy, copper, carbon steel, stainless steel, titanium, and specialty metalproducts to fabricators, manufacturers, and other end users.
In an industry dominated by small, family-owned businesses, {Reliance} grew from a single metals-processing center in Los Angeles into a major corporation by acquiring dozens of competitors. In an interview with an industry publication in 1992, Joe D. Crider, then president and chief operating officer, explained, "You can pay the bill [for higher market share] through price cutting, or through paying goodwill to buy a competitor. In cutting prices, you often trash the marketplace. So over time, the latter route is usually the less expensive, as long as you buy at a reasonable price."
