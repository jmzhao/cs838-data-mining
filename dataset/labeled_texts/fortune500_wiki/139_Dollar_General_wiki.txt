{Dollar General Corporation} is an American chain of variety stores headquartered in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. As of January 2016[update], {Dollar General} operated over 12,400 stores[1] in all U.S. states except: Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Washington and Wyoming.[3]
The company acquired the 280 stores of the P.N. Hirsh Division of Interco, Inc. in 1983, and in 1985 added 206 stores and a warehouse from Eagle Family Discount Stores, also from {Interco, Inc.}[4] In recent years, the chain has started constructing more stand-alone stores, typically in areas not served by another general-merchandise retailer. In some cases, stores are within a few city blocks of each other.
{Dollar General} offers both name brand and generic merchandise — including off-brand goods and closeouts of name-brand items — in the same store, often on the same shelf. Although it has the word "dollar" in the name, {Dollar General} is not a dollar store by the strict definition of that term as most of its products are priced at more than $1.00. However, goods are usually sold at set price points in the range of .50 to 60 dollars, excluding articles such as phone cards and loadable store gift cards.
Outside of larger urban markets and small cities, {Dollar General} often serves smaller rural areas which do not have the customer base for a regular-sized discount department store, such as Beaver, Oklahoma in the Panhandle region, where the closest small city with larger stores is Liberal, Kansas an hour north. It competes in the dollar store format with national chains {Family Dollar} and {Dollar Tree}, regional chains such as Fred's in the Southeast, and numerous independently owned stores.
Since 2000, {Dollar General} has experimented with stores that carry a greater selection of grocery items. These stores, (similar to the Walmart Supercenter, but much smaller), operate under the name "Dollar General Market".
