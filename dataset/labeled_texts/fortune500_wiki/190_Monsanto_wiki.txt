It is headquartered in Creve Coeur, Greater St. Louis, Missouri. {Monsanto} is a leading producer of genetically engineered (GE) seed and Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide.LKB-produkter AB
Notable achievements by {Monsanto} include research on catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation and the first mass-produced light emitting diodes (LEDs) in addition to its work on genetic engineering.
{Monsanto} was one of four groups to introduce genes into plants (1983),[3] and was among the first to conduct field trials of genetically modified crops, (1987). It was one of the top 10 U.S. chemical companies until it divested most of its chemical businesses between 1997 and 2002, through a process of mergers and spin-offs that focused the company on biotechnology.
{Monsanto} was one of the first companies to apply the biotechnology industry business model to agriculture, using techniques developed by biotech drug companies.[4]:2–6 In this business model, companies recoup R&D expenses by exploiting biological patents.[5][6][7][8]
{Monsanto}'s roles in agricultural changes, biotechnology products and lobbying of government agencies and roots as a chemical company have surrounded the company in controversies. The company once manufactured controversial products such as the insecticide DDT, PCBs, Agent Orange and recombinant bovine growth hormone. Its seed patenting model was criticized as biopiracy and a threat to biodiversity.[9][10][11]
In September 2016 {Monsanto} agreed to accept Bayer's offer to purchase the company for $66 billion ($128/share), pending regulatory approval.[12][13]
In 1901 {Monsanto} was founded in St. Louis, Missouri, as a chemical company.[14] The founder was John Francis Queeny, a 30‑year veteran of the nascent pharmaceutical industry. He funded the firm with his own money and capital from a soft drink distributor. He used his wife's maiden name for the company. The company's first products were commodity food additives, such as the artificial sweetener saccharin, caffeine and vanillin.[15]:6[16][17][18][19]
{Monsanto} expanded to Europe in 1919 in a partnership with Graesser's Chemical Works at Cefn Mawr, Wales. The venture produced vanillin, aspirin and its raw ingredient salicylic acid and later rubber processing chemicals. In the 1920s, {Monsanto} expanded into basic industrial chemicals such as sulfuric acid and PCBs. Queeny's son Edgar Monsanto Queeny took over the company in 1928. In 1926 the company founded and incorporated a town called Monsanto in Illinois (now known as Sauget). It was formed to provide minimal regulation and low taxes for {Monsanto} plants at a time when local jurisdictions had most of the responsibility for environmental rules. It was renamed in honor of Leo Sauget, its first village president.[20]
In 1935, {Monsanto} bought the Swann Chemical Company in Anniston, Alabama, and thereby entered the business of producing PCBs.[21][22][23]
In 1936, {Monsanto} acquired Thomas & Hochwalt Laboratories in Dayton, Ohio, to acquire the expertise of Charles Allen Thomas and Carroll A. Hochwalt. The acquisition became {Monsanto}'s Central Research Department.[24]:340–341 Thomas spent the rest of his career at {Monsanto}, serving as President (1951–60) and Board Chair (1960–65). He retired in 1970.[25] In 1943, Thomas was called to a meeting in Washington, DC, with Leslie Groves, commander of the Manhattan Project, and James Conant, president of Harvard University and chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC).[26] They urged Thomas to become co-director of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos with Robert Oppenheimer, but Thomas was reluctant to leave Dayton and {Monsanto}.[26] He joined the NDRC, and {Monsanto}'s Central Research Department began to conduct related research.[27]:vii To that end, {Monsanto} operated the Dayton Project, and later Mound Laboratories, and assisted in the development of the first nuclear weapons.[26]
In 1946, {Monsanto} developed and marketed "All" laundry detergent, which they sold to Lever Brothers in 1957.[28] In 1947, its styrene factory was destroyed in the Texas City Disaster.[29] In 1949, {Monsanto} acquired {American Viscose} from {Courtaulds}. In 1954, {Monsanto} partnered with German chemical giant Bayer to form {Mobay} and market polyurethanes in the United States.[30]
{Monsanto} began manufacturing DDT in 1944, along with some 15 other companies.[31] This insecticide was critical to the fight against malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Due to DDT's toxicity, it was banned in the United States in 1972. In 1977, {Monsanto} stopped producing PCBs; Congress banned PCB production two years later.[32][33]
In the mid‑1960s, William Standish Knowles and his team invented a way to selectively synthesize enantiomers via asymmetric hydrogenation. This was the first method for the catalytic production of pure chiral compounds.[34] Knowles' team designed the "first industrial process to chirally synthesize an important compound" — L‑dopa, which is used to treat Parkinson's disease.[35] In 2001, Knowles and Ryōji Noyori won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In the mid-1960s, chemists at {Monsanto} developed the {Monsanto} process for making acetic acid, which until 2000 was the most widely used production method. In 1964, {Monsanto} chemists invented AstroTurf (initially ChemGrass).[36]
In the 1960s and 1970s, {Monsanto} was a major producer of Agent Orange for United States Armed Forces operations in Vietnam.[37]:6 In 1968, it became the first company to start mass production of (visible) light emitting diodes (LEDs), using gallium arsenide phosphide. From 1968 to 1970, sales doubled every few months. Their products (discrete LEDs and seven-segment numeric displays) became industry standards. The primary markets then were electronic calculators, digital watches and digital clocks.[38] Monsanto became a pioneer of optoelectronics in the 1970s. Between 1968 and 1974, the company sponsored the PGA Tour event in Pensacola, Fla., which was renamed the Monsanto Open.
In 1974, Harvard University and {Monsanto} signed a 10-year research grant to support the cancer research of Judah Folkman, which became the largest such arrangement ever made; medical inventions arising from that research were the first for which Harvard allowed its faculty to submit patent application.[39][40]
{Monsanto} scientists were among the first to genetically modify a plant cell, publishing their results in 1983.[3] Five years later the company conducted the first field tests of genetically modified crops. Increasing involvement in agricultural biotechnology dates from the installment of Richard Mahoney as {Monsanto}'s CEO in 1983.[14] This involvement increased under the leadership of Robert Shapiro, appointed CEO in 1995, leading ultimately to the disposition of product lines unrelated to agriculture.[14]
In 1985, {Monsanto} acquired G. D. {Searle & Company}, a life sciences company that focused on pharmaceuticals, agriculture and animal health. In 1993, its Searle division filed a patent application for Celebrex,[41][42] which in 1998 became the first selective COX‑2 inhibitor to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[43] Celebrex became a blockbuster drug and was often mentioned as a key reason for Pfizer's acquisition of {Monsanto}'s pharmaceutical business in 2002.[44]
In 1994, {Monsanto} introduced a recombinant version of bovine somatotropin, brand-named Posilac.[45] {Monsanto} later sold this business to {Eli Lilly and Company}.
In 1996, {Monsanto} purchased {Agracetus}, the biotechnology company that had generated the first transgenic cotton, soybeans, peanuts and other crops, and from which {Monsanto} had been licensing technology since 1991.[46]
{Monsanto} first entered the maize seed business when it purchased 40% of {Dekalb} in 1996; it purchased the remainder of the corporation in 1998.[47] In 1998, {Monsanto} purchased {Cargill}'s international seed business, which gave it access to sales and distribution facilities in 51 countries.[47] In 2005, it finalized the purchase of {Seminis Inc}, a leading global vegetable and fruit seed company, for $1.4 billion.[48] This made it the world's largest conventional seed company.
In 1999 {Monsanto} sold off {NutraSweet} Co.[14] In December of the same year, {Monsanto} merged with {Pharmacia} and {Upjohn}.[14] The agricultural division became a wholly owned subsidiary of the "new" Pharmacia; {Monsanto}'s medical research division, which included products such as Celebrex.[49]
In 2000: Pharmacia spun off its agro-biotech subsidiary into a new company,[14] the "new {Monsanto}".[50] {Monsanto} agreed to indemnify Pharmacia against potential liabilities from judgments against Solutia. As a result, the new {Monsanto} continued to be a party to numerous lawsuits over the prior {Monsanto}. Pharmacia was bought by Pfizer in 2003.[51][52])
In 2005 {Monsanto} acquired {Emergent Genetics} and its {Stoneville} and {NexGen} cotton brands. {Emergent} was the third largest U.S. cotton seed company, with about 12% of the U.S. market. {Monsanto}'s goal was to obtain "a strategic cotton germplasm and traits platform."[53] The vegetable seed producer {Seminis} was purchased for $1.4 billion.[54]
In June, 2007, {Monsanto} purchased {Delta} and {Pine Land Company}, a major cotton seed breeder, for $1.5 billion.[55] As a condition for approval from the Department of Justice, {Monsanto} was obligated to divest its Stoneville cotton business, which it sold to {Bayer}, and to divest its NexGen cotton business, which it sold to {Americot}.[56] {Monsanto} also exited the pig-breeding business by selling {Monsanto Choice Genetics} to {Newsham Genetics LC} in November, divesting itself of "any and all swine-related patents, patent applications, and all other intellectual property".[57]:108 In 2007, {Monsanto} and {BASF} announced a long-term agreement to cooperate in the research, development, and marketing of new plant biotechnology products.[58][59]
In 2008, {Monsanto} purchased {Dutch} seed company {De Ruiter Seeds} for €546 million,[60] and sold its POSILAC bovine somatotropin brand and related business to {Elanco Animal Health}, a division of {Eli Lilly & Co}, in August for $300 million plus "additional contingent consideration".[61]
In 2012 {Monsanto} purchased for $210 million {Precision Planting Inc.}, a company that produced computer hardware and software designed to enable farmers to increase yield and productivity through more precise planting.[62]
In 2013 {Monsanto} purchased San Francisco-based Climate Corp for $930 million.[63] Climate Corp. makes local weather forecasts for farmers based on data modelling and historical data; if the forecasts were wrong, the farmer was compensated.[64]
In 2015 {Monsanto} tried to acquire Swiss agro-biotechnology rival, {Syngenta}, for US$46.5 billion, but failed.[65] In 2015 {Monsanto} was the world's biggest supplier of seeds, controlling 26% of the global seed market ({Du Pont} was second with 21%).[66] {Monsanto} is the only manufacturer of white phosphorus for military use in the US.[67]
In May 2016, Bayer offered to buy {Monsanto} for US$65 billion.[68][69] A bid of $66 billion was accepted.[70]
Following its 1970 introduction, {Monsanto}'s last commercially relevant United States patent on the herbicide glyphosate (brand name RoundUp) expired in 2000. {Glyphosate} has since been marketed by many agrochemical companies, in various solution strengths and with various adjuvants, under dozens of tradenames.[88][89][90][91] As of 2009, glyphosate represented about 10% of {Monsanto}'s revenue.[92] Roundup-related products (which include genetically modified seeds) represented about half of {Monsanto}'s gross margin.[93]
As of 2015, {Monsanto}'s line of seed products included corn, cotton, soy and vegetable seeds.
Many of {Monsanto}'s agricultural seed products are genetically modified, such as for resistance to herbicides, including glyphosate and dicamba. {Monsanto} calls glyphosate-tolerant seeds Roundup Ready. {Monsanto}'s introduction of this system (planting glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged) allowed farmers to increase yield by planting rows closer together.[94] Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to allow the control of post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage.[94] Farmers widely adopted the technology – for example over 80% of maize (Mon 832), soybean (MON-Ø4Ø32-6), cotton, sugar beet and canola planted in the United States are glyphosate-tolerant. {Monsanto} developed a Roundup Ready genetically modified wheat (MON 71800) but ended development in 2004 due to concerns from wheat exporters about rejection of GM wheat by foreign markets.[95]
