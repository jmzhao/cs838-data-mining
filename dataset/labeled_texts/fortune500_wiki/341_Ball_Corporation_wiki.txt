{Ball Corporation} is an American company headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado, that is best known for its early production of glass jars, lids, and related products used for home canning. Since its founding in Buffalo, New York, in 1880,[2] when it was known as the Wooden Jacket Can Company, the Ball company has expanded and diversified into other business ventures, including aerospace technology, and became the world's largest manufacturer of recyclable metal beverage and food containers.
The Ball brothers renamed their business the {Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company}, incorporated in 1886. Its headquarters, as well as its glass and metal manufacturing operations, were relocated to Muncie, Indiana, by 1889. The business was renamed the {Ball Brothers Company} in 1922 and the {Ball Corporation} in 1969. It became a publicly traded stock company on the New York Stock Exchange in 1973. {Ball} exited the home canning business in 1993. ({Alltrista}, a former subsidiary of {Ball Corporation}, spun off as a separate company and was renamed {Jarden Corporation}. {Jarden} is licensed to use the {Ball} registered trademark on its line of home-canning products, including glass jars and lids.)
