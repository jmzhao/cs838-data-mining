{The J. C. Penney Company}, doing business as {JCPenney}, is a department store with 1,014 locations[1] in 49 U.S. states and Puerto Rico.[5] In addition to selling conventional merchandise, {JCPenney} stores often house several leased departments such as {Sephora}, {Seattle's Best Coffee}, salons, optical centers, portrait studios, and jewelry repair.During my time on the {JCPenney} Board of Directors, I have always advocated for what I believe to be in the best interests of the Companyâ€”its stockholders, employees and others. At this time, I believe that the addition of two new directors and my stepping down from the Board is the most constructive way forward for {JCPenney} and all other parties involved.[42]Penney's logo used from 1963 to 1971.Current {JCPenney} logo,[56] originally used from 1971 to 2011 and reintroduced in 2013.Alternate {JCPenney} logo used on a few stores, used from 2011 until 2012.{JCPenney} logo used from 2012 until 2014 [57]
