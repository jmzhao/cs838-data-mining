Until a spin-off in March 2008, {Philip Morris International} was an operating company of {Altria Group}. {Altria} explained the spin-off, arguing {PMI} would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while {Altria} focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in {Altria} at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by {PMI}'s former owner {Altria}.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
{Philip Morris} is a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team.[4]
