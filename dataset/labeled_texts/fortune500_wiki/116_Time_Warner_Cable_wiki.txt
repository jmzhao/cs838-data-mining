{Time Warner Cable} ({TWC}) was an American cable television company. Prior to its purchase by {Charter Communications} in 2016, it was ranked the second largest cable company in the United States by revenue behind only Comcast, operating in 29 states.[1] Its corporate headquarters were located in the Time Warner Center in Midtown Manhattan, New York City,[2] with other corporate offices in Stamford, Connecticut; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Herndon, Virginia.[3]1 â€“ Still in operation, but no longer offers cable or Internet as part of its services
It was controlled by {Warner Communications}, then by {Time Warner} (the film and television production company and cable channel operator). That company spun off the cable operations in March 2009 as part of a larger restructuring. From 2009 to 2016, {Time Warner Cable} was an entirely independent company, continuing to use the Time Warner name under license from its former parent (including the "Road Runner" name for its Internet service).
In 2014, the company was the subject of a proposed purchase by {Comcast Corporation}, valued at $45.2 billion; however, following opposition to the deal by various groups, along with plans by the U.S. government to try to block the merger, Comcast called off the deal in April 2015. On May 26, 2015, {Charter Communications} announced that it would acquire {Time Warner Cable} for $78.7 billion, along with {Bright House Networks} in a separate $10.1 billion deal, pending regulatory approval.[4]
The purchase was completed on May 18, 2016; {Charter} continues to do business as Time Warner Cable in its former markets, but is in the process of re-branding these operations under the brand Spectrum.[5]
