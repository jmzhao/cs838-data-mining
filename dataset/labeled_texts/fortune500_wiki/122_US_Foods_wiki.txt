On 9th December, 2013, {Sysco Corp} announced it would buy {US Foods} for $8.2 billion ($3.5 billion plus $4.7 billion of debt), [4]but in June 24, 2015, US Federal Judge Amit Mehta ruled that the combined {Sysco-US Foods} would control 75% of the U.S. foodservice industry and that will stifle competition. On June 29, 2015, {Sysco} terminated its merger with {US Foods}.[5][6]
