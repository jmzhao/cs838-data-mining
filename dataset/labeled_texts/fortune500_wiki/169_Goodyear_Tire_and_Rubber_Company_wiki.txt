{The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company} is an American multinational tire manufacturing company founded in 1898 by Frank Seiberling and based in Akron, Ohio. {Goodyear} manufactures tires for automobiles, commercial trucks, light trucks, motorcycles, SUVs, race cars, airplanes, farm equipment and heavy earth-mover machinery.Bad as things are in Indonesia, one positive fact is known. Indonesia has a fabulous potential wealth in natural resources and the New Order [the fascist regime headed by pro-U.S. General Suharto] wants it exploited. So they are returning the private properties expropriated by Sukarno's regime. {Goodyear}'s Sumatran rubber empire is an example. It was seized [by the rubber workers] in retaliation for U.S. aggression in Vietnam in 1965. The rubber workers union was Communist-run, so after the coup many of them were killed or imprisoned. Some of the survivors, you see them here, still work the rubber -- but this time as prisoners, and at gunpoint.[30]Lilly Ledbetter was a supervisor at {Goodyear} Tire and Rubber’s plant in Gadsden, Alabama, from 1979 until her retirement in 1998. For most of those years, she worked as an area manager, a position largely occupied by men. Initially, Ledbetter’s salary was in line with the salaries of men performing substantially similar work. Over time, however, her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority. By the end of 1997, Ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between Ledbetter and her 15 male counterparts was stark: Ledbetter was paid $3,727 per month; the lowest paid male area manager received $4,286 per month, the highest paid, $5,236.[31]
The company was named after American Charles Goodyear, inventor of vulcanized rubber. The first {Goodyear} tires became popular because they were easily detachable and required little maintenance.[citation needed]
{Goodyear} is also known for the Goodyear Blimp. Though {Goodyear} had been manufacturing airships and balloons since the early 1900s, the first {Goodyear} advertising blimp flew in 1925. Today it is one of the most recognizable advertising icons in America.[2] The company is the most successful tire supplier in Formula One history, with more starts, wins, and constructors' championships than any other tire supplier.[3] They pulled out of the sport after the 1998 season. It is the sole tire supplier for NASCAR series.
{Goodyear} is a former component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[4] The company opened a new global headquarters building in Akron in 2013.
