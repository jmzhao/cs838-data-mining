{Aflac Inc.} /ˈæflæk/ ({American Family Life Assurance Company}) is an American insurance company and is the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the United States,[3] founded in 1955 and based in Columbus, Georgia. In the U.S., {Aflac} underwrites a wide range of insurance policies, but is perhaps more known for its payroll deduction insurance coverage, which pays cash benefits when a policyholder has a covered accident or illness. The company states it "provides financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide."[4]
In 2009, {Aflac} acquired {Continental American Insurance Company} for $100 million;[5] this enabled {Aflac} to sell supplemental insurance on both the individual and group platform.[6] As of June 30, 2012, {Aflac} was represented by approximately 19,300 sales agencies in Japan, and 76,900 licensed sales associates in the U.S.[7]
