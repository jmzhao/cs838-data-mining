{Avnet}, Inc. is a business-to-business technology distributor headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona. {Avnet} is a Fortune 500 company and one of the largest global distributors of electronic components, computer products and embedded technology.[4] In 1921, Charles Avnet, a 33-year-old Russian immigrant, began buying surplus radio parts and selling them to the public on the Radio Rows of United States port cities. In the mid-1920s, when factory-made radios began to replace radio parts, {Avnet} adjusted his distribution pipeline and began selling parts to manufacturers and dealers. During the Great Depression, {Avnet} shifted the focus from retailing to wholesaling.[5]
In the mid-1920s to the early 1930s, {Avnet} diversified by branching out into car radio kits and automobile assembly kits. During World War II, {Avnet} made antennas for the U.S. armed forces. His son, Lester Avnet, joined the business at that time.[6] {Avnet} was incorporated in 1955. In 1956, a second connector assembly plant was opened near Los Angeles for the aircraft industry. In 1959, the company went public on the American Stock Exchange. In the mid-1960s, the company briefly owned several record labels including Liberty Records and Blue Note.[7] Over the next ten years, {Avnet} expanded with several acquisitions in the new fields of semiconductors, relays, and potentiometers.[5] CEO leaders since the 1970s for {Avnet} have included Tony Hamilton, Leon Machiz, Roy Vallee, Rick Hamada and William Amelio[8](current). Under Vallee the company acquired 60 companies and grew globally. The company relocated its corporate headquarters to Phoenix (from Great Neck, NY) in 1998.
In July 2010, the company purchased {Bell Microelectronics} for $631M, at the time the largest acquisition in the company's history.[9] In Sept 2016, {Tech Data} purchased {Aunet} Technology Solutions for $2.6B. Industry analysts[who?] say the key to {Avnet}'s long-term success is its supply chain management solutions, which include forecasting component demand, distribution management, Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) and Just in Time delivery.[10] In October 2016, the company purchassed {Premier Farnell} for $691M.
