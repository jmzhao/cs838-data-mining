{KKR & Co. L.P.} (formerly known as {Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.}) is an American multinational private equity firm, specializing in leveraged buyouts, headquartered in New York City. The firm sponsors and manages private equity investment funds. A pioneer in the leveraged buyout industry, the firm has completed over $400 billion of private equity transactions since its inception.[2][3]
The firm was founded in 1976 by Jerome Kohlberg, Jr., and cousins Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts, all of whom had previously worked together at Bear Stearns, where they completed some of the earliest leveraged buyout transactions. Since its founding, {KKR} has completed a number of landmark transactions including the 1989 leveraged buyout of {RJR Nabisco}, which was the largest buyout in history to that point, as well as the 2007 buyout of TXU, which is currently the largest buyout completed to date.[4][5] {KKR} has completed investments in over 160 companies since 1977, completing at least one investment in every year except in 1982 and in 1990.[6]
{KKR} has 13 additional offices in the United States, Europe and Asia.[1] The firm is currently located in the Solow Building (9 W. 57th Street), but recently announced its intentions to occupy a newly constructed 30 Hudson Yards.[7]
In October 2009, {KKR} listed shares in the company through {KKR & Co.}, an affiliate that holds 30% of the firm's ownership equity, with the remainder held by the firm's partners. In March 2010, {KKR} filed to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),[8] with trading commencing four months later, on July 15, 2010.
