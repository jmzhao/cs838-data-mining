{AIG}’s C-suite faced a reckoning at the end of 2015 when four top executives left and CFO David Herzog retired. The management shakeup highlights the tensions between the firm and its investors, including activist Carl Icahn, and the company’s desire to make big changes to mollify shareholders. The struggles may not be ending anytime soon. {AIG} announced in May that it had missed profit estimates for a third consecutive quarter, with per-share earnings 35% off consensus estimates. Part of the battering came from continued exposure to hedge funds, which have been severely under-performing as of late. That’s led {AIG} to announce it’s pulling about 50% of the money it has allocated to hedge funds (so far, it has removed $4 billion). The question now is, how will the firm deal with activist investors like Icahn, who now owns about a 4% stake in the company and previously called for {AIG} to split up into three entities, and the U.S. government, which has deemed it a “systematically important financial institution” (or “too big to fail”). {AIG} can take solace in a recent federal court ruling that said {MetLife} shouldn’t be labeled TBTF.
