{Tyson}’s 2014 purchase of {Hillshire Brands} for nearly $8 billion has paid off big time for the largest meatpacking company in the U.S. The additions of brands like Jimmy Dean, Ball Park, and Sara Lee helped {Tyson} hit record earnings in its prepared foods business last fiscal year. Profits at the company overall were up 41%. The Hillshire deal is part of the company’s strategy to focus on less commoditized products, an approach that also led to record earnings in its chicken operation. {Tyson} had a tough year in beef due to tight supply for cattle, which has led the company to cut back on its beef processing operations. {Tyson} is increasingly looking abroad for growth, although its chicken production in China took a hit as economic growth there slowed.
