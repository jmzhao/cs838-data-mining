Most of the supermarket industry has fallen prey to {Walmart}’s drive into grocery over the last decade–but not {Kroger}. The Cincinnati-based supermarket giant continued its streak in its last fiscal year, as profits jumped 18%, market share increased, and same-store sales grew 5% (excluding fuel) for the year. The fourth quarter of 2015 marked {Kroger}’s 49th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. The 133-year-old company kept up its acquisition tear by buying the {Roundy} chain, giving {Kroger} a foothold in Wisconsin. The company has pursued a robust private label line, with about 40% of its own brand made by the company’s facilities that include dairies, delis, cheese plants, and bakeries. This current fiscal year might not be as rosy for the U.S.’s second-largest food retailer. {Kroger} has warned that its sales growth could be perhaps the worst in more than a decade in part due to shaky consumer confidence and low commodity costs.
