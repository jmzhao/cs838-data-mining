In mid-2015, food distributor {Sysco} called off a planned $3.5 billion merger with U.S. Foods. Regulators killed the deal as the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit that said it would have given the combined company 75% of the national market for distribution services. The failed merger was hard to digest: {Sysco} had to pay a $300 million break-up fee to walk away from the agreement. And for the first nine months of 2016, sales were flat at $36.7 billion. {Sysco} also announced a three-year plan in February 2016 to cut 2% of its workforce and invest more aggressively in technology. U.S. Foods, meanwhile, pivoted with a recent initial public offering that raised around $1 billion.
