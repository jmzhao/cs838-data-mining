Like its bigger rival {Home Depot}, home improvement retailer {Lowe’s} is benefitting big time from the ongoing housing boom. Household formation is up and millions of Americans are renovating their homes. Though {Lowe’s} has trailed its rival in terms of profitability, the company has been making big strides on other fronts, becoming one of the biggest beneficiaries of {Sears}’ shrinking appliance business and proving deft at winning the business of millennials. And {Lowe’s} looks to have snagged home improvement chain {Rona} in Canada, finally turning it into a serious player in that market overnight. Still, {Lowe’s} results have been choppy. And like {Home Depot}, a significant increase in interest rates would likely be bad for {Lowe’s}, potentially shutting the door on the housing boom and hurting sales as well.
