The property and casual insurer has continued its transition to a single {Nationwide} brand for all its subsidiaries. So far the consolidation is paying off. Revenues increased 11% last year, and profits jumped nearly 35%. The boost was in part due to its financial services arm. That business benefited from booming sales of life insurance and retirement plans, as well as an expansion in the assets under management. Assets in {Nationwide}’s mutual funds and retirement plans have ballooned during the ongoing bull market, surpassing $210 billion at the end of last year. That’s generating higher fees for the Columbus, Ohio-based company. As a result, {Nationwide} rose 16 spots on the Fortune 500, to No. 69 on this year’s list.
