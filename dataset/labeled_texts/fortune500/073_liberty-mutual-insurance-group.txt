The 8.3 magnitude earthquake in Chile and resulting floods hit {Liberty Mutual} hard in 2015. Profits at the property and casual insurance company sunk 72% due in part to higher losses from catastrophe claims, both in Chile as well as other parts of the world. The Boston-based insurer also invests in energy projects including oil and gas wells, but those investments have fared poorly as energy prices have fallen, contributing to {Liberty Mutual}’s earnings declines. The 104-year-old company’s revenues also fell nearly 1% in 2015, though it still managed to climb five spots on the Fortune 500, to No. 73.
