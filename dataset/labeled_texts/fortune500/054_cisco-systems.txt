Networking technology giant {Cisco} has seen a lot of change in the past year. Long-time CEO and Silicon Valley luminary John Chambers became {Cisco}’s executive chairman, while Chuck Robbins, a high-ranking {Cisco} sales executive who Chambers once called an “execution machine,” took over as CEO. Chamber now leads a company that faces a rapidly changing technology industry in which more businesses seem to be buying less data center hardware and more cloud computing services from companies like {Amazon} and {Microsoft}. The rise of the cloud has put pressure on {Cisco} to expand beyond its legacy networking gear business, which still brings in billions of dollars each quarter. Over the past year, {Cisco} has made a series of high-profile acquisitions, including a $1.4 billion dollar purchase of Internet-of-things specialist {Jasper Technologies} and a $635 million dollar buyout of cybersecurity startup OpenDNS. Indeed, {Cisco} wants to capitalize on the hot fields of cybersecurity and the Internet of things, in which devices like factory robots and elevators can be connected to the web. The technology titan has made it clear it will spend big bucks on companies to ensure it can lead in those areas. Time will tell if those mega investments will pay off.
