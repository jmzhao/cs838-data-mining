{AmerisourceBergen} is the second-largest distributor of pharmaceuticals in the U.S. As such, itâ€™s subject to many of the same forces affecting {McKesson}, its top competitor. Generic drug price deflation and fewer expected generic-drug launches will put pressure on overall industry profits this year and next. {AmerisourceBergen} has been working to counter those effects by entering new markets through strategic acquisitions. This includes getting into animal health distribution with {MWI Veterinary Supply}, compounding with {PharMEDium}, and clinical trial logistics with {World Courier}. {AmerisourceBergen} also could face a windfall of new revenue in coming years after its partner {Walgreens} absorbs {Rite Aid} and its more than 4,500 pharmacists.
