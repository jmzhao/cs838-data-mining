Bloomington, Illinois-based {State Farm} ended 2015 in the black, buoyed by strong investment gains which more than counteracted an underwriting loss of $4.2 billion. The insurance and financial services firm saw net income soar to more than $2.1 billion — more than double the company’s 2014 net. {State Farm} has also put its backing behind several burgeoning new, and somewhat controversial, technologies in a bid to modernize the risk assessment model. For instance, the company recently became a customer of the fast-growing drone software startup {Airware} in order to inspect home rooftops and collect claims data from the skies. It’s also been pushing for drivers who own car insurance policies to put sensors in their vehicles so that {State Farm} can collect detailed driving data and assess just how much of a risk each of its individual policyholders is.
