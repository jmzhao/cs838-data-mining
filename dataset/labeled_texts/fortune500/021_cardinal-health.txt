{Cardinal Health}, a drug wholesaler that also makes gloves and surgical apparel, has been shoring up its future earnings through a series of strategic acquisitions, development of its alternate care business, and promotion of its specialty drug assets. The company has spent $5.7 billion on acquisitions since 2011, including paying $1.94 billion for {Johnson & Johnson}â€™s Cordis heart-product business. The deal closed ahead of schedule in late 2015. Along with the Cordis integration and a recent deal with {Henry Shein}, {Cardinal Health} will also be focused on its Red Oak venture over the next year. The 10-year split generics buying operation with {CVS} is a strong earnings booster. The partnerships and purchases are a way for {Cardinal Health} to snag a greater share of the medical products sold to hospitals, physicians, and ambulatory centers.
