Health insurance titan {Anthem} announced one of last year’s biggest acquisitions with a proposed $54 billion deal to buy competitor {Cigna}. While {Cigna} has recently warned that the deal may not close in 2016, the combined company would leapfrog {UnitedHealth Group} to become the nation’s largest insurer if approved. {Anthem}, which has more than 38 million people enrolled in its various health plans and boasted $62 billion in 2014 assets, has stood apart from prominent rivals when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Rival {UnitedHealth} recently announced it would be departing from all but a “handful” of the health law’s statewide insurance markets; by contrast, {Anthem} CEO Joseph Swedish told investors in April that a “sustainable market can be built” for the Obamacare exchanges. The company has also been locking horns with pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) {Express Scripts}, the number one provider of such prescription drug services in the U.S. Swedish made waves during this year’s annual {J.P. Morgan} Healthcare Conference when he claimed that Scripts was failing to pass on billions in savings from its price negotiations with drugmakers and threatened to break ties with the {PBM} ({Anthem} is Scripts’ biggest client). The contract dispute has grown increasingly nasty, with {Anthem} suing {Express Scripts} in March for $15 billion in damages and the right to terminate a 10-year contract with the benefits manager; {Scripts} promptly countersued {Anthem} in April 2016.
