{McKesson}, the largest U.S. pharmaceutical distributor, is facing some major obstacles these days. After years of strong sales growth thanks to generic drug price inflation, the tailwind is expected to slow and cut into the company’s overall revenue growth in 2015. {McKesson} also recently lost a handful of customers and could potentially lose another $13 billion worth of revenue in 2018 when (or if) Rite Aid is acquired by {Walgreens}. Management has been working on a series of maneuvers to lessen these blows, including acquiring strategic bolt-on companies to replace lost business and implementing a restructuring plan that’s expected to generate about $180 million in savings this fiscal year.
