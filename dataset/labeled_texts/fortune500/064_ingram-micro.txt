In 1996, Nashville’s renowned Ingram family helped take the electronics and information technology distributor {Ingram Micro} public on the New York Stock Exchange. Now 20 years later, the Ingram family aims to sell its last remaining shares of {Ingram Micro} as the Chinese conglomerate {HNA Group} plans to buy the supply chain company for $6 billion. The deal, announced in February 2016, is the latest in a series of big acquisitions involving Chinese business consortiums wanting to bulk up on foreign companies and investments while China’s economy slows. After the deal closes, which is expected in the later half of 2016, {Ingram Micro} will become a subsidiary of {Tianjin Tianhai Investment Company}, itself a subsidiary of {HNA Group}, and its headquarters will remain in Irvine, California. {HNA Group} said that {Ingram Micro} will be the conglomerate’s biggest business in terms of revenue and will help it expand internationally.
