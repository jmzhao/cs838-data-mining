{CVS Health} is still feeling the pinch from its 2014 decision to drop cigarettes. But the company continues to leverage the positive PR to convince more employers that itâ€™s truly a health care company, allowing it to win new business for its Caremark pharmacy benefits manager. Though the PBM eclipsed its retail drugstore business in size a few years ago, the company continued expanding its {CVS}/pharmacy business, which has been grappling with declines in comparable sales. {CVS} recently took over 1,700 in-store drugstores from {Target} and is rolling out order pickup with tech startup {Curbside} this year. It is also continuing to push healthier food options in its stores to burnish its image as a healthcare company and improve its beauty selection to better compete with arch-rival {Walgreens}.
