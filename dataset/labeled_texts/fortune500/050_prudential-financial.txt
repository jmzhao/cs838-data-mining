Like other insurers, {Prudential} has been under intense earnings pressure because of low interest rates, making it hard for {Prudential} and others to make a return on their investments. {Prudential}’s earnings in the first quarter of 2016 fell 10% short of what analysts were expecting, and things don’t look likely to turnaround in the rest of the year. The company is the second largest U.S. insurer by assets, with 49,000 employees. And while it is based in New Jersey, about half of the company’s profits come from its Japanese operations.
