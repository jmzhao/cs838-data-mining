{Energy Transfer Equity} is an oil and gas pipeline empire built by billionaire {Kelcy Warren with} a spate of M&A deals (Sunoco, Southern Union) that paid off handsomely during the shale boom. At the start of the year, it had a network of around 71,000 miles of pipelines pumping natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, and crude oil. But Warren’s luck ran out last year with a miscalculated approach for {Williams Companies}, just as the oil price crash took its toll on the ‘midstream’ segment. {ETE} persuaded {Williams} to sell itself in September, but the value of both companies has tumbled since then. {ETE} originally agreed to pay $32.6 billion, including $6 billion in cash and the rest in {ETE} shares. Today, {Williams} is worth only $16 billion, and {ETE} is struggling to raise the cash after a sharp decline in its own share price. A bitter and complex legal battle has ensued. {Williams}, which originally refused Kelcy’s advances, is now suing to force the merger through, and to reverse an issue of convertible debt by {ETE} that would dilute its shareholders’ stake in the combined company.
