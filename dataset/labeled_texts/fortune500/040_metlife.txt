Financial services and insurance giant {MetLife} announced Q1 2016 earnings that fell short of expectations, with total operating revenues taking a 2% dip and operating earnings taking a more significant 19% hit. President and CEO Steven A. Kandarian said that the results underscored continuing “market headwinds” but praised the underwriting results. During that same call, {MetLife} also announced it would be pulling out about $1.2 billion of the $1.8 billion that it currently has invested in hedge funds and siphon that money into other investment vehicles, following the lead of other firms like {American International Group}. It’s part of a growing trend away from high-fee funds. The company has also been locking horns with federal regulators who believe {MetLife}, the nation’s largest life insurer, is “too big to fail.” That scuffle has led the firm to consider spinning off its retail insurance and financial product business. However, a federal judge ruled against the government in March 2016, going on to say its designation of {MetLife} as {TBTF} is “arbitrary and capricious.” The government plans to appeal the ruling.
