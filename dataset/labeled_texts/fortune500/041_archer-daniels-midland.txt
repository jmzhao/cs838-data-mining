As goes the commodity market, so goes {Archer Daniels Midland}. Last year that was not a good thing: Sales dropped 16.6%, and profits declined 17.7%. The processor of goods like corn and wheat has been hurt by a strong dollar and a grain surplus, reducing the demand for the {North American supply} it processes and sells. Low oil prices and a glut of ethanol also cut into its manufacturing of the fuel additive. Management is trying to remake {ADM} accordingly, selling off its cocoa business and considering shedding stakes in operations like corn mills that make ethanol. Meanwhile, {ADM} acquired companies like {Wild Flavors}, {Eatem Foods}, and {SCI} to capitalize on consumers shifting their preferences toward natural goods. {ADM} also has made investments in organic, gluten-free ingredient company {Harvest Innovation} and sugar supplier {Wilmar International} to gain a bigger footprint in Asia.
