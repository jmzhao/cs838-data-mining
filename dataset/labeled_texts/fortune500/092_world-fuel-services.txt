For a while, {World Fuel Services} boasted the fastest revenue growth in the Fortune 500 over a 10-year period â€” faster even than {Apple}. The drop in oil prices since late 2014 led to a 25% decline in revenue in 2015, however, with profits falling by a little less. {WFS} specializes in the generally unloved, low-margin business of selling fuel to shipping companies and airlines. Although revenue fell again in the first quarter of 2016, profit margins were stable due to strong demand from airlines. {WFS} also transports crude oil by rail. Last year, it agreed to pay $110 million into a compensation fund for victims of the Lac Megantic disaster in Quebec in 2013, when a train carrying its crude derailed and exploded, killing 47 people and devastating the small town.
