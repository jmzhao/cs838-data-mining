{Costco Wholesale} may be grappling with lower gas prices that are eating into its sales growth, but the bulk retailer still manages to outperform {Sam’s Club} every quarter. {Costco}, which benefits from having stores in more affluent areas than Sam’s does, has been looking to pad its lead by improving its merchandise, particularly fresh food, a key category for getting shoppers into stores. And given how {Costco} is an e-commerce laggard compared to rivals in terms of offering services like store pickup of online orders, finding ways to promote shopper traffic are essential. Some initiatives have included on-site bread baking at some stores. And its $15 billion-a-year {Kirkland} store brand is a cash cow that is only growing in popularity. Still, {Costco} will have to deal with a newly aggressive {Sam’s Club} which has made no secret of its intention to go higher end, aiming squarely at {Costco}’s customers.
