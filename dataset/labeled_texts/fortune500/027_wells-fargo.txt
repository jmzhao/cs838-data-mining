2016 has not been kind to the nation’s largest banks, and {Wells Fargo} is no exception. Its recent performance was weighed down by troubles in the energy sector, as the bank has billions of outstanding loans out to oil and gas companies that are struggling to repay. It’s wealth management division will also now have to contend with the much-feared fiduciary rule, which will upend the way banks like {Wells Fargo} dispense financial advice. That said, the long term outlook for the bank is strong, as it surpassed {Citigroup} this year to become the third largest bank in America by assets, while it is nearly unrivaled in its focus on its main street customers who give the bank more than a trillion dollars in low cost deposits.
