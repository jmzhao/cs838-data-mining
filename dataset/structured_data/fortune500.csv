By giving workers raises and investing heavily in tech, its U.S. division has improved customer service and saw comparable sales rise each quarter in 2015. It is hoping to build on that with a major reset of its food business, which accounts for more than half of its sales, with a bigger focus on organic and fresh food, and by offering curbside order pick up. The retailer has also proven it can hold its own with the tech giants, rollouting out Walmart Pay across the U.S. But huge challenges remain for the world’s largest company. Its e-commerce growth lags that of its main rivals. Its Sam’s Club unit is struggling to keep up with Costco. What’s more, its international division is being buffeted by a strong U.S. dollar that is eating into profits. Total sales fell for the first time in 2015."

Even so, ExxonMobil’s once impregnable balance sheet is showing holes: the company lost its AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor’s in April after 67 years. Total spending on investments and dividends was 40% more than the combined cash flow from operations and asset sales in 2015 (it wants to cut capex by 25% this year). ExxonMobil remains the industry benchmark for everything from profitability to safety standards, but its rocky relationship with climate change remains its Achilles’ heel. State attorneys in both New York and California have opened probes into whether it misled investors over the risks to its business from climate change, against a background of allegations (which it denies) that it suppressed scientific research that came to inconvenient conclusions."

In April 2015, the Apple Watch arrived to mixed reviews and modest sales. And though debate raged for a bit about the state of Apple’s sales in China amid a slowing economy there — including an unusual August 2015 email from CEO Tim Cook to CNBC host Jim Cramer claiming no summer slowdown — the year ended on a weak note for the company in Asia. Lately, hopes have turned to the next iPhone upgrade cycle and a push to focus on India, where Apple’s market share remains miniscule. Still, even with the growing concerns, Apple’s next big leap came into view in 2015. Dubbed Project Titan and staffed with hordes of former car industry experts, Apple’s effort to leapfrog the automobile market with an electric masterpiece likely won’t reach consumers for a few more years.

Both decisions speak to the insurance giant’s willingness to go it alone. That makes sense given its sheer size and the reach of its business–UnitedHealth has more than 100 million global customers. The insurer has also grown its health services platform Optum and pharmacy benefits unit OptumRx with major investments like the $12.8 billion buyout of Catamaran, as well as a recent mail-order prescription drug distribution agreement with pharmacy chain Walgreens which positions UnitedHealth as a competitor to CVS Health and Express Scripts."

A continued assault from revitalized wireless carrier T-Mobile helped strip away almost two million of AT&T’s monthly mobile subscribers. And the old legacy landline phone business accelerated its decline, losing almost 10% of its revenue from the year before. So CEO Randall Stephenson made two bold gambles that may — or may not — pay off in coming years. First, he spent almost $50 billion to acquire satellite television provider DirecTV. Along with its existing cable television offering Uverse, the move immediately made AT&T one of the largest TV subscription services in the world with 26 million U.S. customers and 19 million overseas. AT&T also acquired Nextel Mexico and Iusacell for less than $5 billion. Combining the two and upgrading its Mexican infrastructure could pay off if Latin America continues to grow faster than many other parts of the world. In the meantime, AT&T can profit from the immense flow of trade and communication between the U.S. and Mexico. The television play looks riskier, as cord cutting accelerates among millennials and Internet video services like Netflix gain momentum."

In the process, Immelt is dismantling the legacy of his legendary predecessor, Jack Welch. In early 2015, Immelt and his team made the landmark decision to sell most of GE Capital, the lending business built by Welch that once generated half of the conglomerate’s profits but sank under the heavy regulatory regime adopted following the financial crisis. In just eighteen months, Immelt has sold, or reached agreements to shed, $171 billion of the financial arm’s $200 billion in assets. In mid-January 2016, GE agreed to unload another barely profitable bulwark, its consumer appliance franchise, to Haier of China for $5.4 billion. Immelt is betting heavily on lighting homes and powering plants across the globe; in November, GE acquired the power generation arm of France’s Alstom for $10 billion, greatly strengthening its reach in gas-fired, “combined cycle” plants that are driving the industry’s growth. So far, the results are mixed. In the first quarter, three GE staples — jet engines, medical equipment, and power generation — all showed good revenue growth, while two others, oil and gas, and transportation equipment, including locomotives, dropped sharply. All told GE’s industrial profits fell 7% from the first quarter of 2015. Indeed, the strategic thrust is daring, and so far shareholders are applauding: Since the start of 2015, GE’s stock has delivered a 25% return, easily waxing the S&P 500 by 23 points."

That required selling off profitable but geographically remote landline telephone and FiOS cable television and Internet businesses in California, Texas and Florida to Frontier Communications for $10.5 billion. He raised another $5 billion selling off rights to more 11,000 cellular towers. Still, McAdam did need to make a few strategic additions. Verizon has frequently been rated as having the most comprehensive and widespread wireless network in the country but those airwaves have been filling up and getting ever more crowded. So McAdam spent big at the government’s Advanced Wireless Services spectrum auction, grabbing another 181 licenses.

The fact that it is required now to send all of its profits to the Treasury rather than rebuilding its capital is controversial because the policy means that Fannie would have to tap the Treasury again if the market goes sour and it starts losing money once again.

Big-ticket items like power washers and lumber have been selling well. The only leaky faucet in its business outlook is the specter of higher interest rates that could slow housing market. Still, all signs point to continued momentum. Home Depot expects 1.9 million households will form this year, up from 1.3 million last year. And with nearly two-thirds of U.S. homes older than 30 years old, there will be need for home improvement products for a long time."

Same-store sales were up 5%, driven by higher customer traffic. The company continued its push internationally with the acquisition of Australian chain Trade Secret. E-commerce still remains an insignificant piece of the business, making up just 1% of the company’s total sales.

After a credit rating downgrade in April, CEO Ryan Lance made cutting the company’s $25 billion debt pile top priority, which suggests it won’t be heading to the bankruptcy courts with a glint in its eye in search of bargains in the shale sector. Nearly 10% of its production is bitumen, which requires expensive processing before it can be transported and sold. That means it’s squarely in harm’s way in the battle for market share being waged by low-cost OPEC producers.

Although revenue fell again in the first quarter of 2016, profit margins were stable due to strong demand from airlines. WFS also transports crude oil by rail.

Exelon, which was born out of a merger in 2000 between Unicom and PECO, operates 23 nuclear reactors across the North-East and Midwest. These represent some 60% of its generating capacity (the rest is either fossil fuel-burning or renewable) and were the main source of its earnings until collapsing oil prices and subsidies for renewables started to undermine wholesale power prices. They’re now looking increasingly challenged: the company is threatening to close efficient nuclear plants in Illinois if local lawmakers don’t vote through a bill that would compensate them for the zero-carbon quality of their energy. The costs for nuclear decommissioning are likely to rise in the medium- to long-term, whatever the fate of the Illinois bill.

Fox also faced a drop-off in revenue from its film unit after last year’s offerings failed to live up to the company’s blockbuster 2014. The company then kicked off the current year by offering voluntary buyouts as a means to cut $250 million from its film and TV units.
